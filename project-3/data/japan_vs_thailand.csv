JapanTravel,Hakone or Yokohama with hakone day trip,"Been going back and forth with what we should do. 

14 day trip starting in tokyo 3 night, kyoto 3 night, osaka 2 night, **back to tokyo 2 night, hakone 2 night.  depart from HND** 

I know it doesn't logistically make sense but it was an option to check out a ""nicer"" hotel with my CC points. Just looking at my itinerary im exhausted and im wondering if i should re adjust it so I either stay in tokyo longer before my flight. ( we would still have to swap to another hotel) or swap to yokohama for 2 nights and do a day trip to hakone instead.  If it was just my wife and I we would just tough it out with the travels but we have our toddler (almost 2 year old) with us.  

I feel like going back to tokyo then back out to hakone then traveling to HND is a huge waste of travels.  Not even staying at a nice ryokan in hakone just have a couple suite rooms booked at a hyatt regency .  

Should I swap?"

To help, a little bit about myself is that I am a 30 year old male American citizen (moved when I was 25). I am not into Anime, Pokemon, or that sort of thing so won't be any help regarding that type of question. I am very outdoorsy and watch/play a lot of sports.

Is it better to buy it in Japan and have it shipped via a post office service? Or buy my own big box when I get there and just check it in and add it to the things I'm carrying back home (with my luggages). or would you say it's better to just buy it online and pay for the what I assume is going to be very expensive shipping?

JapanTravel,Japan Trusted Traveler (TTP) Renewal Report,"A few years ago, I wrote [a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/7eaxrv/experience_the_japan_trusted_traveler_program/) about enrolling in Japan’s [Trusted Traveler Program](https://www.isa.go.jp/en/publications/materials/ttp2_index.html). The details and mechanics of the program haven’t really changed, so I won’t go over them again. I’m just going to write a brief update on my renewal process.

Although the TTP site in English currently says they aren’t doing inspections, a couple of users messaged me about having their primary inspections done lately, and a little bit of sleuthing on FlyerTalk showed me processing was happening as usual. This was great, as my husband and I had been waiting for them to reopen applications so that we could renew, since we were both due for a renewal in 2020 (which obviously didn’t happen). It’s worth pointing out that the Japanese version of the site doesn’t have any mentions of them halting applications, so I probably should have looked sooner.

By the time I figured this out, it was late February. We were in Japan back in October/November, and we had a trip planned for March, so we submitted our applications hoping that they’d process our primary inspections within two weeks. There’s actually no such thing as “re-applying” for TTP; you just need to do the full application process all over even if you’ve had it before. But you do have to have entered the country twice in the last six months to qualify, so the timing was perfect.

Luckily for us, they processed our primary inspection of documents in 11 days, so we were good to go for our secondary inspections. I have no idea if this sort of speed is usual. It may have been due to the fact that we were previously part of the program, or it might have been due to our quickly approaching dates in Japan (they ask you when you plan to return next). Either way, we gathered our printed documents and Global Entry cards and packed them for the trip.

The next hurdle was figuring out when/where we were going to have our secondary inspections done. There used to be a lot of dedicated counters for this, but if you look at [the list](https://www.moj.go.jp/isa/publications/materials/ttp2_pre-check_pre-check_document07.html), you can see a lot of them are still temporarily closed (at least as of writing this in March 2023).

We decided we were going to try at the Osaka Immigration Bureau, since we had a few open days in Osaka at the beginning of our trip. There wasn’t a lot of information about whether they were actually processing secondary inspections or not, but we figured we’d try and figure out a Plan B later if needed.

Well, no need for a Plan B, thankfully! My husband grabbed our revenue stamps from a convenience store, and we arrived at the Osaka Regional Immigration Bureau this morning around 9:15am. You can proceed directly upstairs to the third floor, and there are signs for the “automated gate” office. When we got there, we handed over all our documents, passports, and GE cards.

The staff member in charge told us it would be “an hour or two”, but we were actually entirely done in 45 minutes. I have a feeling it would have been slightly shorter for one person, but they did ours simultaneously. Everything went smoothly. We had our pictures and fingerprints taken, waited while they checked everything, and signed some forms. After that, they printed our cards and we were done at about 10:00am.

Complete success! I have a feeling that if the Osaka Regional Immigration Bureau was comfortable with the process, the Tokyo Immigration Bureau would be, too.

A few things to note:

* Although TTP typically has a three-year validity period, my husband’s passport expires before three years are up, so his TTP also expires when his passport expires. Basically, I don’t recommend getting TTP if you passport is expiring soon, since the validity date is either “three years or until passport expiration, whatever comes first.”
* TTP will get you through long COVID checking and immigration lines at airports quickly, as you are an automated gate user as part of TTP, similar to a resident who holds a zairyu card.
* You can still get a JR Pass and do other tourist-only things (like tax-free shopping) with TTP. When you go through the automated gates, it prints “Temporary Visitor” on the back of your card, alongside your visa validity dates. This also means you only need to carry your TTP card with you in Japan (not your passport), as the card is the proof of you being in the country legally."
JapanTravel,Kamikochi-Yari-Hotaka,"Hey all, first reddit post :) I’m going to Japan for my first time this July and want to do a multi-day trek in the Northern Japan Alps. The one I’ve read the most about online is the Kamikochi-Yari-Hotaka trek. It looks amazing! But I’ve also read how strenuous and dangerous it is. I want to get more advice since I have no experience in the region.

In the past, some of the harder hikes and multi-day treks I’ve done are: Annapurna Circuit (plus Tilicho) - 16 days, max altitude 5400m

Volcan Misti, Peru: 2 days, 1 night, 5820m

Presidential Traverse, New Hampshire, US: 1 long day, no altitude, just rocky, icy, strenuous hiking for 20ish miles with some scrambles

I’m in good shape in terms of running/endurance, and I’ve done some backpacking recently, but I haven’t done any really hard hikes in a couple years. My boyfriend and I have read a little about Kamikochi-Yari-Hotaka and he feels like it might be too dangerous, especially since it seems like there’s a significant risk of falling. If anyone has any advice on whether I seem prepared for this trek, and/or options they might recommend instead let me know! Happy to provide more info as needed. Also, are there guides available for Kamikochi-Yari-Hotaka? I don’t have any buddies planning on going with me."

JapanTravel,Takayama to Gujo-Hachiman,"I’m planning a trip to Japan and one of our stops is Takayama, where we will stay for 2 nights. Is it worth adding another night to visit Gujo-Hachiman? I’d really like to go, but there comes the issue of renting a car (or two) for our group, which is not too practical, as we don’t have many drivers and none of them are used to driving on the left side of the road, or taking a very long train ride to the town. Is it worth it? If not, is there anything else in or near Takayama that would warrant us staying there longer? Thanks."

JapanTravel,17-day itinerary (May-June). Please tell me if it makes sense or if I have lost my mind lol," Hi all, 

I will be travelling to Japan with a friend. No hotels have been booked yet, but the flights have (which is why I have to come back to Tokyo at the end of my trip). I want it to be as stress free as possible.

* May 28 – Narita &gt; Tokyo
* May 29 – Tokyo 
* May 30 – Yokohama
* May 31 – Tokyo
* June 1 – Disney Sea
* June 2 – Tokyo
* June 3 – Nikko 
* June 4 – (Nikko &gt; Tokyo &gt; Osaka) Osaka 
* June 5 – Himeji Castle (night in Osaka)
* June 6 – Nara (night in Osaka) 
* June 7 – Kyoto
* June 8 – Kyoto
* June 9 – Kyoto
* June 10 – Hakone
* June 11 – Tokyo 
* June 12 – Tokyo
* June 13 – Tokyo &gt; Narita 

Total: 6 nights in Tokyo, 1 night in Nikko, 3 nights in Osaka, 1 night in Hakone, 2 more nights in Tokyo.

Another option would be to *go to Kanazawa instead of Nikko*, and do the following:

* May 28\~June 2 – Tokyo
* June 3 – Kanazawa 
* June 4 – Kanazawa &gt; Kyoto 
* June 5 – Kyoto
* June 6 – Kyoto 
* June 7 – Nara (night in Osaka)
* June 8 – Himeji (night in Osaka)
* June 9 – Osaka
* June 10 – Hakone
* June 11\~June 13 – Tokyo 

&amp;#x200B;

***Questions***

* Do you find the JR pass valuable for this itinerary?
* Are there too many day trips? Should I change any of them? 
* Would you go to Kanazawa or Nikko?
* Is it cohesive? Any changes you would propose?

Thanks in advance! :)"

JapanTravel,Itinerary advice for a 21-day trip to Japan,"• Me and my friend are traveling to Japan in July for a 21-day trip to visit my boyfriend and our friends while visiting the country for the first time. 

• Our budget is also pretty flexible but we're trying to save as much money as week can when possible (hotels, transportation). We don't mind splurging for exciting opportunities, however.

&amp;#x200B;

• Our plan right now is as follows:

• July 5th - 7th: Landing in Tokyo and spending a few days here to adjust to the time difference and explore some local sites like the Imperial Palace.

• July 7th - 16th: Bullet train to Osaka where we're staying with our friends. We're also thinking of taking a bunch of day trips during this period to USJ, Dontonbori, Kyoto, Kobe, Nara, and Amanohashidate (as well as any other close-by locations - this period is pretty flexible). When our friends aren't working, we'd travel with them to their favorite local spots :)

• July 16th - 19th/20th: We're looking to spend this time in another part of Japan - preferably a national park or some nature-y location. We're not sure where we want to go but we were looking at Ise Shima National Park since it's relatively close to Osaka. We were also looking at the Yura area to potentially visit the Totsui Limestone Caves and Mt. Kuroshima. We're open to going a little further for this time period. We'd more specifically like to spend this time in a location that is tourist friendly, full of nature/history, and train accessible from Osaka.

• July 19th/20th - 23rd: Traveling back to Osaka to spend a few more days with our friends/squeeze in some more sight-seeing and sentimentality :')

• July 23rd - July 25th: Leave to go back to Tokyo and stay for a couple of days before our flight out of Japan.

&amp;#x200B;

• Any advice is welcome! Some extra info: Our flights in and out of Japan are booked. Our hotels are booked for both of our Tokyo stays. We also plan on getting the Japan Rail Pass for the 21 day period as we'll be taking a ton of trains/want the freedom not to worry about train prices. While we're in Osaka, our living accommodations are taken care of with our friends (which is why we're primarily staying centrally in Osaka). We understand July isn't super ideal to travel to Japan cause of the heat/humidity, but this is the only time we're able to go (still super excited!!).

• Thank you so much for helping out and taking a look at our trip! This is our first time traveling like this and we want to make it super memorable as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Any suggestions are greatly appreciated as we're pretty overwhelmed with all of the possibilities! :)"
JapanTravel,Ta-Q-Bin Questions,[removed]
JapanTravel,Itinerary Check 13 days in June," 

Hello, I’m(22M) going on my first solo trip to Japan in June 16 and it’ll last about 13 days. I just made a rough itinerary on places I think would be great to visit.

These are just rough guidelines that I made. I won't be able to visit all of them but I'm wondering if it's good or if there are too many things I added all at once. I'm going to get the JR pass to offset the transportation costs but I'm also unsure if some of the lodgings will cost too much. I'm thinking of staying at a nice ryokan once or twice, otherwise I'm planning on using hostels and capsule hotels, and maybe cheaper ryokans. My budget will be around $2000-2500. Also, I'm wondering about the booking situation. Do I have to book everything(as in lodging and events) before getting into the country or can I walk in on some places? Additionally, how would the weather situation be in mid June? What clothes should I bring? Any recommendations and feedback would be much appreciated. Thank you!"

JapanTravel,Short course/retreat?,"Hello. I'd like to come to Japan as a solo traveler and start my trip off by doing something like a watercolor class every day for a week. Where could I find resources on art classes / retreats that could provide a kind of framework for when I first arrive? Ideally in Tokyo but could be cool to do 3 days in a different place. Open to art or learning any other kind of thing. (cooking, writing, theatre, meditation, etc)."

JapanTravel,What are some fun things to do at night in Japan that is NOT drinking?,"Hey all! My boyfriend and I (mid 20s) are going to Tokyo/Kyoto for about 10 days in early May (4th- 14th) and we’re super excited! Both of us are down to go to bars 2-3 of the nights we’re there, but neither of us are huge alcohol drinkers so that’s enough. We’d like to go to bars to check out the ambience and see any cool interiors, but for other nights, we’re a bit afraid of not having a lot of fun late night activities to do. We intend to maximize our time there, so hoping we don’t end up just marinating in our hotel rooms after dinner and a walk every night. Would love to hear some recommendations from y’all on any non-alcohol, unique, interactive activities that could be done between 8PM-12AM. We are open to things of any price, so any suggestions are welcome. Thank you so much!!"

JapanTravel,Help With Finding A Destination B/W Kansai Region and Tokyo,"Hi everyone, 

I'm heading to Japan in the fall and trying to get all my destinations in order so that I can begin booking accommodations. I have a few days available between my time in the Kansai region and when I return to Tokyo. I'm looking for somewhere else to go but having a hard time deciding and also debating adding another day to Tokyo to stay in 2 different parts of the city during my time there (would then have 2 available days)

I'm a 30 year old, Male traveler who will most likely be solo for this part of the trip. I enjoy food, alcohol (sake included), historical places, and cultural experiences but I'm open to a lot! I am currently learning Japanese at school and should know enough to get by in places where English is barely used as I can already understand many simple things. 

Kanazawa or Takayama seemed like they could be an interesting destination but also seemed like I might be adding too much to my itinerary at that point and not be able to fully enjoy my time in each place or wear myself out.

A true onsen experience might be wonderful during this time but I am not sure I would want to do an onsen without anything else nearby for that amount of time.

Right now I have the following penciled in:

Nov 18: Arrive Haneda 5pm, stay in Tokyo
Nov 19: Depart in morning to Kyoto, stay in Kyoto
Nov 20: Kyoto
Nov 21: Kyoto
Nov 22: Depart Kyoto, day trip to Nara, stay in Osaka
Nov 23: Day trip to Himeji castle in morning, for the the rest of the day, stay in Osaka
Nov 24: Osaka
Nov 25: Depart to Koya, stay in Koya
Nov 26: Koya
Nov 27: Open
Nov 28: Open
Nov 29: Open
Nov 30: depart to Tokyo, stay in Tokyo
Dec 1: Tokyo 
Dec 2: Tokyo
Dec 3: Tokyo
Dec 4: Tokyo
Dec 5: Tokyo morning, head to Narita for 5pm flight

If anyone has some past experiences they loved that would fit well here, feel free to share! Thanks!"

JapanTravel,Itinerary check - Am I committing a sin skipping Kyoto in favor of nature / less crowds?," 

At the start of April I'm heading to Japan with my girlfriend for 16 days, and after she leaves I'll spend one more week by myself in Tokyo for work.

I've been trying to make a travel plan that has a bit of everything but with an overall focus on nature &amp; relaxation. As we're not a huge fan of city and crowds and want to experience nature without rushing, we are currently planning to skip Kyoto/Osaka in favor of more nature focused places as including Kyoto would mean more rushing and crowds (which is exactly the thing we're trying to avoid).

We don't have a super tight / detailed planning apart from rough days and accommodation which we mostly booked already but with options to cancel if anything changes.

Day 1 - 4 &gt; Tokyo, simply exploring the city

Day 4 - 8 &gt; Rent car and drive to Nikko, spend 3 full days there exploring nature / hikes

Day 8 - 10 &gt; Spend 2 nights just northwest of Minakami, close to Kosatsu but in a quiet Ryokan/Onsen more embedded in nature.

Day 10 - 12 &gt; Visit Kusatsu in morning and take stroll, drive to Okutama and stay in a Ryokan in Kosuge (small village) for 2 nights

Day 12 - 14 &gt; Hokane Ryokan stay, exploring the area

Day 14 - 16 &gt; Drive back to Tokyo, spend last days there

Day 16 - 23 &gt; Tokyo for work (some daytrips here and there perhaps)

I tried to find places that are not too rural, but somewhat away from the huge crowds. I know places like Nikko might be busy, but I think getting out in nature it won't be a problem getting away from them.

I'm wondering if there's anything in the route that we're taking that we should definitely not miss out on, and also whether Hokane still adds anything based on what we're doing before (as we're staying in Ryokans before that as well) and whether it's worth it also based on the fact that I heard it's very crowded which is the thing we're avoiding. I really wanted to visit Kamikochi but it seems we're a bit too early. Oh also, would we need winter tires or should we be OK without? Anything else worth considering?

I've had a lot of fun exploring the countless options (there are so many great places so it's hard making choices) and based what I found online this would look like a very fun trip.

However, I'm sure I don't have the full picture so I really appreciate any feedback or tips given. :)

Cheers"

* Night life is optional (really, we rather enjoy convenient store's snacks to wind down)
* This would be our first time in Japan, so we would like to see as much sceneries as possible
* Other than maybe 2 or 3 meals at Kura Sushi or Ichiran, any recommendations?

&amp;#x200B;

November 10 - Arriving at Osaka at 9am. To unwind and unpack. 

&amp;#x200B;

November 11 - Getting the Osaka Amazing Pass for 2 days

* Osaka Castle
* Kuromon Market
* Osaka Aquarium
* Tempozan Giant Ferris Wheel
* Dotonbori

&amp;#x200B;

November 12 - Osaka and heading to Kyoto

* Umeda Sky Building
* Shinsekai
* It's empty here as I originally planned to head to Nara just to see the deer, but opted to skip this in the end. So the rest of this day is pretty much empty until we head to Kyoto in the evening. Tempted to put USJ here just for the Nintendo World.  


November 13 - Kyoto (Arashiyama)

* Bamboo forest
* Tenryu-ji
* Teogetsu-kyo bridge
* Sagano scenic railway
* Gion  


November 14 - Kyoto (Thousand gates)

* Fushimi Inari
* Nijo Castle
* Kiyomizu-dera
* Kyoto Tower  


November 15 - Kyoto (Temples)

* Kinkaku-ji
* HIgashiyama Jisho-ji
* Eikan-do Temple
* Philosopher's path?

&amp;#x200B;

November 16 - Kyoto to Tokyo

* Early morning Shinkansen to Tokyo, any recommended timing to set Mt Fuji on the way to Tokyo?
* Hachioji 
* Shibuya crossing
* Teamlab Planets

&amp;#x200B;

November 17 - Tokyo

* Tsukiji Outer Market?
* Asakusa-jinja Shrine
* Pokemon Centre 

&amp;#x200B;

November 18 - Tokyo Disneyland

* We have been to Paris and HK disneyland, would Tokyo's be similar? Would consider DisneySea but it does not look as appealing as disneyland 

&amp;#x200B;

November 19 - To leave Tokyo

* Flight home is at 11pm so we have a whole day of empty itinerary, appreciate any recommendations to fill up the day.

Is there anything I should look out for? I think a JR Pass would not be worth it as we will only be taking 1 or 2 shinkansen trip (kyoto &gt; tokyo and/or osaka &gt; kyoto). I think Suica can be used throughout Japan? And each of us will get a simcard to keep in touch.

JapanTravel,Okunoshima and Onomichi in one day?,"Hello there,

I am currently planning a few things for our trip in May, we will be in Japan for 3 weeks. For one week we will be using Kyoto as our base and I am currently looking into some day trips. One thing which is really high on the list is: Okunoshima. My girlfriend is a big bunny fan and we considered going there many times, but never went. This time I want to make it happen! 

If we are starting at 9am in Kyoto we will be in Okunoshima a bit after 12 (depending on the ferry we are taking). Taking the Nozomi would be quicker, but this is not part of the JR pass. 

From what I was reading on different sites and what I can imagine to make sense, we spend 2-3 hours on the Island, which mean we still had the afternoon for something else. Sure we could travel back directly. But on the other hand I know that Onomichi is quite close and I have heard from many people that it is quite cool and know it from Yakuza 6 ;) 

Technically it is one the way back to Kyoto via Fukuyama. 

So my two questions are:

1.) Is it too ambitious to spent 2-3 hours after Okunoshima in Onomichi?  
2.) If not, do you have any recommendations how to make the best out of the time there?  


A few thoughts what I would maybe do in Onomichi (given the fact that we don't have a lot of time):  


* Going up with Mt. Senko-ji Ropeway and enjoy the view &amp; the temple
* Neko no Hosomichi
* Enjoy onomichi-ramen for dinner

Thank you!"

Or would it be better to spend a few days in Shinjuku and then book a hotel in some other district to keep moving around the country? 

My thought process is that it'll be less of a hassle to just stay at one hotel the whole time and do day trips. But then I worry that I may not get a proper experience of seeing the country or that there may be many things happening that is not possible to do in a one day trip using just public transport."

Background: This will be my 6th trip to Japan in the last decade, so not a Japan newb anymore. Not into J-pop, and not really into anime, but do appreciate anything from a historical/cultural point of view.   I've been to Okinawa, and most common tourist places from Himeji to Nikko, so this time, I'd like to focus on Kyushu (from Nagasaki to Hiroshima). I'll be flying into Fukuoka.     

I have a few question categories so feel free to answer as much or as little as you'd like.    

\[Trip date: March 18-26\]    

&amp;#x200B;

**Olle Trails:**   

I've hikes all 27 Olle trails in Jeju and loved them, so am very excited to try at least 1-2. I found the main website, but can't really determine which ones would be good? Anyone who has been to Jeju, how do the olle compare? Which ones are your favorites? I was going to visit the ""hells of beppu"" so was thinking of doing the one in Oita but any guidance is appreciated.   

**UNESCO World Heritage Sites:**   

I am a unesco whs buff and also run a WHS blog. I've been to 10 sites in Japan and hope to hit a few more. Most are straight forward, but these three I had questions about:

*Iwami Ginzan Silver Mine and its Cultural Landscape*   

\-This looks like a 6 hr one day trip from Hiroshima BUT a 2 hr drive. Is there a bus or any other faster transport. I am willing to pay more, as I will likely not dedicate another 8 days in the nearby future to Kyushu/Lower Honshu so I am thinking this is my last shot at this site. Also any general vibes or your thoughts on it. 

*Yakushima*   

\-This looks straight forward but a few commercial sites kept telling me a car is a must. Is this true. I did get an international driving permit recently if this is true, and I've driven in Okinawa before, but am just as happy in public transport. Also, what are the highlights in your opinion? I got the official website's recommendations but they are biased of course.

*Sacred Island of Okinoshima and Associated Sites in the Munakata Region*   

\-My understanding is that the main island is forbidden for tourists to visit but there are other sites as part of the WHS in upper Kyushu. Is this correct? I read something about tours to Okinoshima but didn't understand if that was to the main island or other nearby islands.    

**Other Stuff:**  

\-Cherry Blossoms - We have them too in Korea so not really crazy about going to some festival. Here, imho, it is best to avoid the festivals and just find a place where there are plenty of blossoms and less people. Is there something like that (anywhere around Kyushu).

\-Cat Islands (Ainoshima / Ao Island) - I love cats. Are these islands really not that touristic or are they...like petting zoos? I have seen online articles describing them as quiet fishing villages, but I am skeptical since everyone and their mama seems to know about them. Which of the two would you recommend?   

\-Beppu/Nagasaki - I plan to do day trips to each. Yay or Nay?   

Anyways, thanks for all of your help."
JapanTravel,Osaka and Kyoto Trip May 2023 (Need recommendations),"Hi Guys,

I've been to Japan many times and most recently Hokkaido and the last time i was in Kyoto or Osaka was about 5 years ago and between pandemic and border closure i am sure things has surely change.

I was just wondering if there was any local or recent visitor that found some hidden gem food spots or activities in Kyoto or Osaka that you could share.

Like in Kyoto i will be re-visiting Kichi2 Omurice and Fire Ramen, but also blind what else to try in the 2 days i will spend there. 

Any suggestions would be greatly be welcomed :) thanks guys

\- Nick"

How likely would a walk-in be? I’m a solo traveler. Feeling sad, I was really hoping to go to Kichi Kichi"
JapanTravel,Visiting Universal Studios in Osaka,[removed]
JapanTravel,5AM Arrival… then head to DisneySea??,"Like the title alludes to, we arrive into Haneda at 5AM and our hotel is in Ginza but we can’t check in before 3pm (we emailed to confirm this, they said it was a slight possibility the room could be ready sooner, but only guarantee would be if we pay for the prior night). We can drop our bags in advance of check-in, which we are planning to do. Then we are thinking to go to DisneySea for the day (using ‘day’ loosely). 

As we see it
Pros: manufactured fun. One stop shop. Food, sights, wonder. You just show up. Doesn’t require much navigating/wayfinding once we reach the park (in comparison to being in and around Tokyo) Probably will have a good amount of English speakers/signage (not as much brain power required) We have a kid and Disney (at least in Florida and California) is already full of screaming kids so if he’s miserable he’ll fit right in? Probably a more stroller friendly location in Tokyo so he could sleep in his stroller for hours undisturbed …in theory …

DisneySea was lower on our list and we thought to skip it initially, so if we only survive a few hours, still way cheaper than going in US and we at least experienced it some.

Trying foods and seeing merchandise unique to DisneySea, maybe a ride or two, and then we can say we experienced it. Or maybe the excitement and adrenaline will carry us through? 

Cons: jet lag. Misery. Shortchanging ourselves on this experience. I booked Teamlabs for the next morning at 10:30am so we will be on somewhat of a schedule the following day and can’t sleep in for unlimited hours. 

We only have 8 days so I would love not to “waste” one. And either way we possibly can’t get into our room/bed until 3pm. 

What am I not thinking about? Is my perspective totally off ? Shoot me straight. Except please no feedback about traveling to Japan with a kid b/c I already know ppl on this sub think it’s insane. 

Any alternative suggestions on how to spend that day?"

JapanTravel,Itinerary Check - Family of 3 - Tokyo and Osaka,"Hello everyone. My wife (39F) and son (7M) and I (39M) are traveling to Japan from the USA at the end of this month. This is the second trip for me and my wife, and she was pregnant the last time we went in 2015, so maybe you could almost count my son... That trip was only 4 days because of her pregnancy. and it just was not long enough. We loved it there. We originally planned THIS trip for 2020 so that we could attend the Olympic games, but when that got cancelled, we were able to get all of our money refunded - eventually. We booked our flights through Air Canada via a deal website, and it took over 2 years to get that money back in the form of a credit voucher. We held onto our money we had saved for the trip, and rebooked everything this past fall.

My cousin lives and works in Japan as a teacher at the US Army base in Zama to the SW of Tokyo proper, and we are staying with her for most of the trip. She is my favorite cousin, and has a son a couple of years older than mine, so we are looking forward to seeing them. This of course saves us a lot in lodging costs, but will definitely cost us some convenience, since we will have to travel in and out of the city each day, and she has to escort us in and out through base security. They are off for spring break, so they will be doing a lot of the activities with us. I mention all this because i think it's relevant to scheduling, since it's a rather unique lodging situation. My wife's main goal for this trip is to eat good food, and mine is to eat good food and squeeze in as many Japanese craft beers as I can find without dragging the rest of the group down. I have several restaurants and breweries/tap rooms with addresses in my notes for when we are out and about. My son's goal is Super Nintendo World.

**We are arriving at Narita on Friday 24 March at 17:00**

Exchange cash - Collect wifi hotspot (we both have brand new iPhone 14s, locked, so I can't get an eSIM) - Collect 7-day JR Passes and seat reservations (not activating pass yet) and purchase Suica cards - Purchase tickets for Keisei Skyliner and travel to Zama where my cousin will pick us up from her local station - Will there be issues with trains running through 21:30 - 22:00?

**Saturday 25 March**

Rest and hang out with my cousin, make plans for ""free days"" with restaurants and beers as mentioned above

**Sunday 26 March**

Free day - Travel into Tokyo for some shopping/eating based on input from cousin

**Monday 27 March**

Activate JR Pass for this day - I am leaving by myself at 09:00 to travel to Hakone where I have booked a car rental/driving tour with fun2drive where I will drive with a group around mountain roads near Mt. Fuji, with a stop at Fuji Speedway. This drive starts at 12:00 and goes to 17:00 when I will travel back to Zama. I don't know what the rest will do. Maybe nothing, maybe going into Tokyo again.

**Tuesday 28 March**

We have tickets for Disneyland for all 5 of us for this day. It is our only plan.

**Wednesday 29 March**

My family (3) is traveling into town for brunch or lunch before we board the Shinkansen for Osaka. Packing as light as possible. I have routed this out to arrive around 17:00 to our ryokan hotel a couple of blocks west of Dotonbori. Check in, and head out for dinner, return to hotel.

**Thursday 30 March**

Transit to USJ from hotel to arrive \~08:00. We have tickets and express passes with entry to SNW after lunch (13:30 I think), so we plan to check out/ride what we can before we head into that area. This is the planned highlight of the trip, and a major bonus from the 2020 letdown, since it was not open back then. I have purposely tried to avoid outright walkthrough videos of the park to avoid spoilers, while researching the process of actually getting into USJ and SNW as much as possible. Stay as long as we can stand and transit back to hotel.

**Friday 31 March**

Check out of hotel, visit Osaka Castle and stuff ourselves with street food for lunch at Dotonbori. Transit back to Shinkansen station for trip back to Zama.

**Saturday 1 April**

Free day - Travel into Tokyo for some shopping/eating based on input from cousin - we may do the Ninja Restaurant or Gonpachi Nishi-Azabu (the Kill Bill restaurant)

**Sunday 2 April**

Free day - Travel into Tokyo for some shopping/eating based on input from cousin - we may do the Ninja Restaurant or Gonpachi Nishi-Azabu, whichever we didn't already do, or something else entirely lol

**Monday 3 April**

Pack up and travel back to Narita via N'EX. Outbound flight is at 17:00 - we land in Toronto at 16:00 same day, and I have booked a hotel at the airport for our 15hr layover. All of the available Air Canada flights stopped at Toronto and Montreal, and most were 6-8 hrs at BOTH places. I opted for the longest layover possible in either of the two, so that we could get some rest instead of just sitting in the airport for what would have to be the most miserable day of our lives...

**Tuesday 4 April**

We fly out of Toronto at 07:00, connect to Montreal for 3 hours, then finishing up at Atlanta where we drive home to Alabama. I am hoping this extra night before in the hotel helps get us on the road to recovery for the jet lag."
JapanTravel,Nature-Oriented Travel in May,"Hello,
I am currently planning to travel to Japan in Early/Mid-May. I recently found this sub and see some amazing destinations! I had my mind set on travelling to Hokkaido/Sapporo but there were some comments on the slush and not-so-good weather there during this time. I am traveling alone and can drive. I am dedicating this to a ""healing"" type of trip where I can just enjoy the beauty of nature as well as learn more about Japanese culture. 

Any tips and recommendations would be more than helpful. Thanks in advance!"

JapanTravel,Itinerary check! 17 days May/June. Tokyo-Yakushima-Kagoshima-Hiroshima-Osaka-Kyoto-Tokyo,"Hi all

Our third reschedule of our planned May 2020 trip seems like it’s happening! It’s my/spouse third time in Japan, traveling with 2 people who haven’t been before, so revisiting the classic spots. Not super interested in fine dining when in Japan, and not big party people. Traveling from the US, we tend to fall asleep pretty early too. I hope this itinerary won’t seem too hectic, it’s actually toned down from our usual pace. I am a to-the-hour planner, aiming to be a bit looser to accommodate our bigger, mixed age travel crew. For non-speed runners, does this seem like a reasonably balanced plan with enough nap gaps?

JapanTravel,21 day itinerary check - how busy is it? / additional suggestions?,"Hi guys,

Traveling to Japan for the first time in my life arriving on March 23rd and leaving on April 13th. We are a 33 y.o. couple, we will have a JR pass and have all nights booked of course. We would like to try some typical dishes for sure without being able to spend too much though (Sushi, ramen, tonkatsu, gyoza, konbini food), I'm a \`\`mild\`\` fan of mainstream anime/Shōnen and Ghibli movies. Interested in taking long walks and visiting temples without going into temple-overload, and taking some nice pictures, hopefully with some Sakura viewing. A bit worried about crowds being too much, but nothing we can do about that during Sakura season so getting mentally prepared. Our itinerary looks like this:

Day 0 (March 23rd, Thursday) - Tokyo - Landing at Narita around 4 PM, after 30 hours travel from my country. I expect to be heavily jet lagged and tired, 12 hour timezone difference, so I don't plan on anything on this day. Just arriving in our hotel in Asakusa, picking up something from a nearby konbini and sleep as needed. Night in Asakusa.

Day 1 (March 24th, Friday) - Tokyo - Asakusa (Senso-ji, Nakamise and Kaminarimon) and Sumida Park in the morning for cherry blossom viewing. Ueno park/Ameyoko for lunch and early afternoon, then going into Akihabara for afternoon shopping (Radio Kaikan, Super Potato, Bookoff? maybe a Game Center) + dinner. Night in Asakusa.

Day 2 (March 25th, Saturday) - Tokyo - Chidorigafuchi and Imperial palace gardens in the morning. Ginza for lunch and early afternoon, mainly for Ginza Itoya / Uniqlo (until around 5 PM), then going to Teamlab Planets where we have tickets for entry 6.30 - 7.00 PM. Back to Tokyo Tower for some night photos and then Ginza/Shinbashi for dinner. Night in Asakusa.

Day 3 (March 26th, Sunday) - Tokyo - Shinjuku Gyoen in the morning, for some more cherry blossoms, Meiji Shrine/Harajuku, then going to Shibuya for some lunch and Shibuya Parco for Pokemon Center/Mega Donki (we might move Shibuya to  our April leg in Tokyo If this day is too full). Afternoon/sunset we would go to Nakameguro to see the illuminations (If they occur this year) or just to be by the riverside. Night in Asakusa.

Day 4 (March 27th, Monday) - Hiroshima/Miyajima - Shinkansen to Hiroshima arriving by lunchtime. Okonomimura for lunch, Hiroshima Peace Park. Ferry to Miyajima in the afternoon for check-in at hotel (probably will grab some dinner at a konbini previous to crossing as we know dinner options are scarce in Miyajima). Depending on the time of arrival, we might take a walk around Itsukushima shrine and that's it. Night in Miyajima.

Day 5 (March 28th, Tuesday) - Miyajima - Full day for Miyajima, trying to take it easy and visit Itsukushima shrine, Daisho-in and, only If time allows, take the funicular up to Mount Misen. Night in Miyajima.

Day 6 (March 29th, Wednesday) - Himeji/Osaka - Ferry back to Hiroshima and Shinkansen to Himeji, spending 3-4 hours in there visiting Himeji castle grounds (not sure we´ll go inside) and Koko-en. Train to Osaka in the afternoon. Staying around Osaka Namba, so planning on having dinner in the area and visiting Dotonbori. Night in Namba (Osaka). 

Day 7 (March 30th, Thursday) - Osaka - Full day for Osaka, planning on visiting Osaka castle (from the outside) and Yasaka Namba shrine in the morning, Shin Sekai for lunch, maybe afternoon in Den Den Town and back for dinner/evening in Dotonbori/Namba area. Night in Namba (Osaka). 

Day 8 (March 31st, Friday) - Koyasan - Traveling to Koyasan for arrival around lunch time, check-in at our accommodation and visiting a few temples (Kongobuji, Danjo Garan complex). Okunoin cemetery tour at 7 PM. Night in Koyasan.

Day 9 (April 1st, Saturday) - Kyoto - As this is a Saturday where we'd be arriving in Kyoto during full bloom, we know crowds will be extremely heavy, so we plan on taking it easy. Well have lunch around Kyoto station, leave our luggage in the hotel and go to Arashiyama to visit Gio-ji (maybe), Otagi Nenbutsuji and Adashino Nenbutsuji temples. Dinner reservation for 7.30 PM at a sushi place we got a recommendation for (near Nijo castle). Night in Kyoto.

Day 10 (April 2nd, Sunday) - Kyoto - Early morning - 7 AM?- for Fushimi Inari to beat (some of) the crowds, spending 2/3 hours hiking a bit and taking pictures. Train to Nara for lunch and full afternoon (Todaiji, Nara Park, Kasuga-taisha, maybe Sahogawa riverbed for sunset). Train back to Kyoto at night for late dinner probably at Konbini or Kyoto station. Night in Kyoto.

Day 11 (April 3rd, Monday) - Kyoto - Early morning for Sannenzaka and Ninnenzaka to beat some of the crowds for nice pictures, Kiyomizudera. Walk through Southern Higashiyama, Nene-no-michi/Ishibei-koji lane up to Maruyama Park and Heian Shrine. Afternoon in Gion. Night in Kyoto.

Day 12 (April 4th, Tuesday) - Kyoto - Early morning for Arashiyama (Bamboo grove and Monkey park for sure, optionally Okochi-Sanso villa If worth it?). Lunch near riverside and then going to Narutaki station for Sakura photographs, going afterwards to Kinkakuji. Night in Kyoto.

Day 13 (April 5th, Wednesday) - Kyoto/Nagoya - Morning for Philosophers path, including visit to Ginkakuji and Honen-in, Nanzen-ji and Keage Incline. Then having lunch and taking the train to Nagoya, depending on the arrival time might walk a little bit around Nagoya (Tsuruma park If with sakura?). Night in Nagoya.

Day 14 (April 6th, Thursday) - Nakasendo - In the morning going from Nagoya to Magome, to do the Magome-Tsumago section and onto Nagiso. Around 3 PM back to Nagoya and another train to Takayama to spend the night. Night in Takayama.

Day 15 (April 7th, Friday) - Takayama - Full day for Takayama (Takayama Jinja, Old town, Daioji temple). Night in Takayama.

Day 16 (April 8th, Saturday) - Shirakawa-go/Kanazawa - Bus to Shirakawa-go in the morning, spending 3-4 hours there, then onto Kanazawa around 1 PM for lunch (Omicho market maybe?) and check-in at hotel. Afternoon for Kanazawa. It might already be too late for Sakura. Night in Kanazawa.

Day 17 (April 9th, Sunday) - Kanazawa - Full day for Kanazawa (Higashi-chaya district, Kanazawa castle grounds and Kenrokuen). Asian Riverbed for sakura viewing only If in bloom or just afterwards. Night in Kanazawa.

Day 18 (April 10th, Monday) - Tokyo - Arrival around noon from Kanazawa via Shinkansen. Having lunch and going to Ghibli museum for 2 PM entrance tickets we have. No fixed plans afterwards, we might spend some more time in Kichijoji near the museum, going back to Shinjuku for hotel check-in and dinner would be either around Golden Gai/Omoide Yokocho or Shin-Okubo. Stay in Shinjuku.

Day 19 (April 11th, Tuesday) - Tokyo - Kamakura day trip from Tokyo probably, we might either add Enoshima for the afternoon/sunset or go back to Tokyo and spend some more time around Shibuya/Shinjuku. Dinner around Golden Gai/Omoide Yokocho or Shin-Okubo, but could be somewhere else. Stay in Shinjuku.

Day 20 (April 12th, Wednesday) - Tokyo - This is a free day we would leave for last day to take it easy and some more shopping, maybe re-visiting some places we liked or alternatively choosing among other temples to visit (Gotokuji, Nezu shrine, Mabashi Inari?) or other neighborhoods (Yanaka Ginza? Shimokitazawa?) for a different Tokyo vibe. Afternoon will probably be back in Shibuya If we did not have enough time for Megadonki / Daiso / Pokemon Center beforehand. Dinner around Golden Gai/Omoide Yokocho or Shin-Okubo but could be somewhere else. Stay in Shinjuku.

Day 21 (April 13th, Thursday) - Leaving Tokyo - Nothing planned for this day as we will be taking the Narita Express for our flight departing Narita 5.20 PM (planning to arrive 3 hours in advance). Might take a walk around Shinjuku or Shibuya, or some last minute purchases.

\------------------

Mostly my look for help here is related to the following:

\- How packed is our itinerary? Do you think any particular day seems to be too much in paper or impossible to enjoy because of cramming too much?

\- Any suggestions on itinerary/sightseeing spots change in any of the cities/places we are intending to visit?

\- Any particular recommendations for Day 20? As you see we have it quite open.

\------------------

Thanks so much for taking a look at this and for anything you can say about our itinerary!"
JapanTravel,"A rough itinerary with many questions. June 24-July 21. Tokyo, Chubu, Kyushu","
Hi! I’m in my mid-30s traveling alone. I went to Japan in 2019 and loved it. I ended up spending pretty much the full two weeks in Tokyo which I don’t regret because it was great and I could probably go back and spend another two weeks+ there again but this time I really do want to see more of the country. 


My interests are:
* jpop/idol culture/JDramas

* Japanese ball jointed dolls

* history, interested in the Meiji era but other parts as well! One of my biggest regrets is I didn’t see any castles the last time I went, I’d love to see more castles even reconstructions I don’t mind especially if they have a nice area around them or a museum or display inside. I really love museums!

* trains but also things like ropeways and other unique ways to get places 😆 


I have tickets already to three concerts: Nagoya on June 25th, Osaka on July 9th and Tokyo on July 16th. Obviously I will plan my trip around this.


When I began planning I had so many ideas of where I wanted to go but I really don’t want to rush and the idea of changing hotels a lot or moving around too much makes me anxious so I’d rather keep a few bases and do day trips. 

Anyway to start with


Saturday June 24 Narita -&gt; Nagoya

- land in Narita after 13 hour flight, flight lands at 4:15 PM
- possibly pick up SIM card?
- train to Shinkansen station, Shinkansen to Nagoya 
- get to hotel near station and die (probably stop at combini first)


Sunday June 25 Nagoya 

- concert day! This will probably take up all day, I’m meeting with friends and they might have ideas about what to do. 


Monday June 26 Nagoya/Inuyama

- train to Inuyama
- Meji Mura, I REALLY want to go here this is a must
- Inuyama castle- if I’ve started the day early enough and I’m feeling up to it
- back to Nagoya


Tuesday June 27 Nagoya

- explore Nagoya
- Nagoya Castle/Honmaru Palace 
- Tokugawa Art Museum/Garden 
- Osu Shopping Street
- Atsuta Shrine (maybe)
- Toyota Techno Museum (maybe)

Ok so here’s where my questions come in. I have so much I want to do and I’ve cut that I have three completely different ideas of what I want to do for the next week or so. 


Choice #1: Stay around the Chubu area


Honestly I’ve been thinking this over for a while but I haven’t fully settled on which order to do this one. I’d like to go to Takayama, Matsumoto and Kanazawa so I’m thinking…


Wednesday June 28 Nagoya -&gt; Takayama

Thursday June 29 Takayama 

I’m thinking of skipping out on Shirakawago and for these days just visiting the old town, checking out the festival museums and Hida Folk Village. I’ve seen mixed feelings on Hida Folk Village but it seems like something I’d like. I was interested in the Shinhotaka ropeway and considered spending an extra day but it seems like it’ll be closed 😔 


Friday June 30 Takayama -&gt; Matsumoto

Saturday July 1 Matsumoto

I’d really like to see this castle. Also check out the city art museum. Time piece and Ukiyoe museums maybe?


Sunday July 2 Matsumoto -&gt; Kanazawa

I’m really interested in doing the Alpine Route but also unsure about it. Is it worth doing? Is Sunday a bad day? Should I stay an extra day and do it Monday? Should I skip it and just go a different way? Also if I don’t do it might it be better to switch the order I do Matsumoto and Takayama?

Monday July 3 Kanazawa
I don’t have any specific plans for what I’d like to do in Kanazawa but it seems nice. 

Tuesday July 4 Kanazawa -&gt; Osaka


REWIND


Choice #2: Go to Kyushu


I know this will be a super long ride but I’d like to take the train instead of flying. 


Wednesday June 28th Nagoya -&gt; Nagasaki 
Thursday June 29th Nagasaki 
Friday June 30th Nagasaki

Visit the Peace Park and museum, Glover Garden, Dejima, Mount Inasa. Maybe some of the churches. 


Saturday July 1 Nagasaki -&gt; Fukuoka
Sunday July 2 Fukuoka
Monday July 3 Fukuoka

I want to take a day trip to Kumamoto from here. I’m really interested in the castle and the mascot 😆 

One of the reasons I’m extra interested in visiting Fukuoka this time is because I’d like to see the Hakata Gion Yamakasa display floats. 


Fukuoka-&gt; Osaka 
 
I’m considering taking the overnight ferry to Osaka. If I do that it would be the night of the 4th probably? It looks like it might be kind of neat but I’m not sure. 


Choice #3


Neither! Go straight from Nagoya to Osaka and just stay there the extra week. I have lots of trips I’d like to take in the Kansai area I’m sure I could fill two weeks around there alone. The concert there is on the 9th. I won’t get in to my plans for there here because isn’t this long enough?


Around July 12 or 13 I would head back to Tokyo. 


I’m just curious about thought on this. I’m also considering the season. I know it’s the rainy season and also hot, it’ll be extra hot in Kyushu, will it be nicer in the Alps or just foggy and muddy?"

JapanTravel,Planned trip over festive period 2023/ 2024,"Hello. 

My wife and I and our two kids (current ages 11 and 6) are in the planning stages of a trip to Japan. None of us have been before so it's kind of intimidating trying to come up with a plan for the trip so I was hoping you could help out..... 

We are looking at going to Japan over the festive period - flying out from the UK on 22/12 and staying over for about 18 days. 

We are currently thinking about flying in and out of Osaka and traveling the 'Old Golden Route' up to Tokyo then taking the 'New Golden Route' back to Osaka - the idea is that we want to see as much of Japan as we can but don't want to overstretch ourselves.... plus we are all wanting to dedicate a good amount of time in Tokyo - and we would like to be in Tokyo over New Year. 

The rough plan is:
23/12 - 24/12 - arrive in Osaka and explore
25/12 - Mario World
26/12 - 28/12 - Kyoto
29/12 - 05/01 - Tokyo - might see about a day trip to Mt Fuji or to Hakone for an overnight stay during this time.
06/01 - 07/01 - Nagano / go see snow monkeys at Yudanaka - stay at an on-sen
08/01 - 09/01 - Kanazawa for Kenroku-en
10/01 - 11/01 - back to Osaka - maybe trip to Kobe or could go to Nara for a day trip if possible
12/01 - fly home 

Are there any must see areas along the Golden Routes? 

This is a very rough itenary and we are open to suggestions. 
 
Any advice is greatly appreciated and thank you"

JapanTravel,Itinerary check: one month trip,"Hi everyone, I am hoping for some itinerary advice. My partner (his first trip) and I (my second time - I lived in Osaka for a year but over 10 years ago now so not concerned with doubling up places I’ve been before) are going for four weeks in October.

We are trying to get a good balance of modern, traditional, mountains and sea. We are late 20s and relatively fit so happy to be out and about exploring on foot/bike but equally want to experience some of the quieter areas 😊

In particular I would love some suggestions for the five nights towards the end - spread these out among other places or are there other recommended places to visit?

29th Sept: arrive in Tokyo early evening

Tokyo: 3 nights

Hakone: 2 nights

Kyoto: 7 nights 
- day trip to Nara
- day trip to Arashiyama

Osaka: 3 nights
- this is where I lived so will be visiting friends and my host family
- day trip to Kobe

Hiroshima: 4 nights
- visit my cousin and his family

At this stage we now have 5 nights spare, not sure whether to extend some of the earlier places or head to a new place (or two) for example Nagano.

Kanazawa: 2 nights

Tokyo: 5 nights 
- potentially a day trip to Nikko

Thank you in advance!"

JapanTravel,Mt Fuji area / Gion Festival recos,"We are a family of four (kids 17 and 16 yo).  Spending July 3-16 in Japan.  Rough itinerary is Tokyo (6 nights), Mt Fuji area (2 nights), Kyoto (5-6 nights).

I have two questions:

1 - where should we stay in Mt Fuji area?  We're debating staying in Hakone or Kawaguchiko, or possibly Izu Peninsula (Shuzenji or Heda).  Our goal for these couple of days is to enjoy nature, view Mt Fuji, do some hiking/outdoor activities, and experience an onsen ryokan.  Any recommendations among these locations?  And, any recommendations for a particular onsen ryokan in this area?  I hear great things about Gora Kadan, but I know there are hundreds, curious if there are any strong recos?  We are willing to splurge a bit for a nice onsen ryokan experience.

2 - our Kyoto visit coincides with the Gion Matsuri festival.  It sounds like there are festival activities for the whole month of July, and then a big evening event July 16 (Yoiyama) and then parade on July 17 (Yamaboko Junko).  My question - for those who have experienced the festival - is whether these two days are particularly special?  Our original plan was to leave Kyoto on July 15, but it sounds like staying through the 17th would be well worth it.  Any thoughts?"

* 12th Wednesday - TOKYO
* 13th Thursday - TOKYO
* 14th Friday - TOKYO
* 15th Saturday - OSAKA

JapanTravel,Help needed with 2nd part of itinerary end of June,"Hi everyone!

My girlfriend and I (both in our thirties) are traveling to Japan in June. It is my first time visiting Japan, my girlfriend already went a few years ago to Tokyo-Kyoto-Osaka. We both like food culture, arts, nature and try to find a bit of a balance during this trip. We managed to do this in out first couple of weeks, by dividing our time in the Alps, Kanazawa, Osaka and Naoshima. I will not go into detail about this part of our itinerary, because my question is about something another part.

I've really enjoyed reading about Japan and also this subreddit. But all this research has resulted in serious doubt. On June 21th, we will leave Osaka and have to be back in Tokyo on the 30th. Since it is end of June I red that Tohoku (esp. Aomori, Akita or Iwate) and Hokkaido are interesting in terms of the weather and the fact that it is more off the beaten track. 

That's why we were thinking of spending those 10 days (including travel days) around the North part of Honshu and/or Hokkaido . But since that part of Japan is also huge, it notice that I am stalling to make a decision. Therefore I am really curious to hear suggestions on what to do: is it worth it go to the North or Hokkaido (even when it costs a bit of time)? And suggestions on specific areas where we can combine some interesting sights? Or maybe do an interesting loop with the train or car? I also want to hear if the weather argument should not impact our decision and thus staying in West-Japan is more convenient. Please feel free to share any thoughts or tips to help us with our standstill!

Important detail, we decided on not taking any domestic airplanes. We love to take trains , and we will have an JR pass. Moreover, we are used to traveling in countries where trips of 12+ hours are normal so we are fine with spending for example an almost full day on a Shinkansen. Even though I completely understand that my time in Japan is valuable and you don't want to sit on a train all day.  But if one or two long traveling days will bring us the perfect diversity in our itinerary, we are absolutely willing to sacrifice this time.

Would love any feedback and suggestions. Thank you in advance!

JapanTravel,"looking for Nitama, the cat railmaster","Hi all, 

I am traveling to Japan in January of next year and I have a very specific thing I want to see. I'm looking for the cat conductor (I think her name is Nitama).

Right now I don't have anything specific planned in my itinerary, except I'm flying in and out of Tokyo. I'm willing to literally just have a day of train travel, scenery and eating in cafes to meet this cat.

However, the most recent Google article I read said that Nitama is now a priest at a shrine. There is mention of another replacement cat conductor, Yontama, but there's not a ton of info online.

I can be the only one that has done this very unique pilmigrage. Has anyone does this, and from what city as a base? Can I go to the shrine, if she really is a priest there? Also, it says she doesn't work if the weather sucks-- is January not going to be a good time to do this? Would hate to make this rural pilmigrage if there's a good chance I don't see her"

We were thinking of doing Izu for around 7/8 days and see Hachijojima, Aogashima, Mikurajima and Miyakejima.

Background: 50s (m) - U.S. - conversationally fluent. Lived/worked in Japan before. Visiting to finalize some estate paperwork for family member and staying extra to reconnect with my former home of eight years. While I enjoy anime (Attack on Titan, Demon Slayer, etc.) I’m not an aficionado so won’t hit many of the stores others have in their itineraries. Long haul COVID fun means I have to manage energy well so most days I’ll work in a good nap/rest period most afternoons.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm mainly looking for more floating checklists items that I can weave into my schedule as energy/good allow - would appreciate recommendations for tonkatsu places, fun izakayas, small mom/pop places with good vibe/food. I'm not into the Michellin star/reserve 6 months in advance places. Also enjoy finding little bars/pubs with limited seating that aren't hostess/gotcha places. Not really into Karaoke but will cheer others on. My floating list so far:

* Hiking trips: Mt Kobo, Kinchakuda, Mount Tsukuba - idea is to get away from the congestion and see new areas, get my steps in (though I’ll be walking a lot every day). I don’t mind train travel at all.
* Stationary stores (don’t judge me - I like nice pens and different journals)
* Kappabashi (just want to see the different knives and learn more - not planning on buying unless I just fall in love with a chef’s knife)
* Catch up on 20 years of missed TV shows, comedies, music - I’ll be furiously taking notes, bookmarking stuff and then finding it during down time.
* Yokohama? Been to Tokyo 20+ times and never made it to Yokohama.

&amp;#x200B;

Itinerary:

Day 1 (Wed): Land 5:40 pm in Haneda, will take train or bus to Shinjuku area then walk to hotel. Hope to get out to see local hanami or if up to it, might go to Chidori ga fuchi to view cherry blossoms at night. Will grab food on the go. Just hope to make it to 9 or 10 pm.

Day 2: March 22-23 should be peak blossom time so all about the hanami, Chidori ga fuchi boat trip (if didn't make it previous night), Shinjuku Gyoen, - will organize by opening times/distance, going to furthest spot at 9 am then working way back. By afternoon will need a nap then will find an Izakaya and reacquaint myself with Japanese beer and whisky.

Day 3: Hike 1 then Yoyogi park and work my way to Omotesando/Harajuku. Meeting friend for early dinner and drinks. 

Day 4: Nakameguro for hanami (may go sooner) - may repeat earlier places - will weave into remaining days as long as blossoms remain. Saturday and don’t want to bother with reservations/lines so will conbi/street food it as needed. Shibuya crossing &gt; Akihibara &gt; then head back towards hotel and hit Golden Gai.

Day 5: Hike 2 then paperwork/estate prep stuff.

Day 6: Tsukuji market early (Sushi Dai/similar) then Teamlabs, Miraikan Science Museum, maybe Odaiba, take water bus from Toyosu to Asakusa and wander around.

Day 7: Hike 3 then final paperwork over dinner. May stay over and head back late morning.

Day 8: Will find some chill cafes to read and recharge (introvert - the estate stuff will be exhausting). Might find an onsen to unwind more then start day drinking and call it an early night.

Day 9-11: No set plans yet - will take a few hikes as energy allows, possibly stringing some together so I can hit 2-3 places outside of Tokyo, reconnect with friends, and revisit any new favorite places.

JapanTravel,Itinerary Check - 6 days in Tokyo,"Hi all,

I (33, male from the UK) am travelling to Japan for 16 days solo in May and have been looking at plenty of guides, itineraries and videos to try and help put something together which is a good mix for a first time visitor.

Quick summary is I would be interested in cool buildings, food, views/nature, shrines/temples. I don't have as much of an interest in things like anime/manga etc hence not featuring much allotted time)

So far I have worked on the initial Tokyo leg which is below (although I do come back to Tokyo for one more full day at the end, I have already assigned that to the Sumo tournament which I'm hoping to get tickets for).

As I am very loose with my plan so far, I am more than happy to rip up the itinerary or make major changes if it doesn't make sense logistically/is too packed/there are 'better' options with my time. It is also more a skeleton of the areas I'll be in rather than being specific with where I'll eat/shops I'll go to/activities etc.  
Please feel free to criticise the plan as it stands and if you can, offer alternatives I can build on. Also worth knowing if any activities don't really make sense for someone on their own.

**Underneath the itinerary is currently the additional activities I have not yet been able to slot in as I'm not sure of where would be best to put these.**

Also, you will notice that the evenings are very bare bones currently. I am struggling to make decisions on what to do in the night time as a solo traveller (it is the part giving me the most anxiety currently). As this will be my first solo trip to Japan, I am not sure what to expect for this part and also what it will be like going out alone. I am not a big drinker however I am OK to 'get involved' considering this is a rare holiday for me.

Thanks!

* Ueno Park (seemed nice however already visiting Yoyogi and Shinjuku Gyeon - worth swapping in for one of them? Or adding as a third?)
* Tokyo Olympic Stadium tour (I like sport so thought this would be interesting - however is it worth the trip?) It looks like it could fit on the Shinjuku day?
* Buy a Goshuincho for temple visits (and where would sell a nice one as a keepsake)
* Ghibli Museum (I enjoy Ghibli films however not clamouring for Park tickets, however the museum is well reviewed and if I can add it in it would be nice)

**Restaurants/cafes I've been told to visit (your own guidance welcomed!)**

* Han-no-daidokoro bettei
* Happy Pancake
* Ninja Restaurant Akasaka (would this be silly to do alone?)
* Dawn Cafe
* Harry Potter Cafe Asakusa
* Akihabara Menya Musashi Bujin
* Homemade Noodle Billiken

After writing it out it feels very empty at the moment - I have been advised to not cram too much in. Am I being far too cautious at the moment?"

JapanTravel,Finding Touge,"こんにちは

My name is Nick and I am coming to Japan for three weeks on April 27!  I am a car enthusiast and have dreamt about exploring the car meets and touge in Japan.  I have found some excellent car meets but am struggling to find touge.  As touge is a small and secretive community, I am wondering if there is anybody that could help me out.  I would truly be grateful for any help, ありがとう."

JapanTravel,23 Day Itinerary Check with some questions,"Hey everyone! I'll be heading to Japan for the first time in late April/early to mid May this year. I'd love some feedback on my itinerary  since I haven't navigated the country before, and I have some follow up questions at the end. 

My trip will largely be focused on picturesque settings for photography as well as many food and drink experiences with some splurging on luxuries in between. Once I finish in Tokyo I plan to do a lot of eating and drinking as well as some shopping and exploring quirks of the city as well.

The itinerary is as follows: 

Day 1 4/21: Arrive Narita. Check duty free whiskeys for anything good. NRT express to Tokyo, store empty suitcase in train station until day 14 return to Tokyo. Dinner. Sleep

Day 2 4/22: Travel to Nara, explore deer park and walk through city while recovering from jet lag

Day 3 4/23: Day trip to Mt Yoshino. Get lunch at yoshino station. Hike to upper area, return to Nara in evening. Backup if Yoshino is not worthwhile: Go to Osaka a day early.

Day 4: 4/24: Travel to Osaka, explore Osaka

Day 5 4/25: Osaka - zero things planned.

Day 6 4/26: Travel to Kinosaki, possible pit stop at Himeji Castle. Settle into ryokan, enjoy onsen and kaiseki dinner.

Day 7 4/27: Morning in Kinosaki, Travel to Kyoto. Check into Kyoto TBD lodging, dinner, search for cocktail bars.

Day 8-10 4/28-4/30: Kyoto for 3 full days. Seeing the usual highlights, looking for good dining/coffee/cocktails as well as photo spots.

Day 11 5/1: Travel to Takayama, explore Takayama. See Ida No Village, Shinhotaka Ropeway. Maybe Shirakawa go but worried about crowds. Drink sake. Find scenic photo spots.

Day 12 5/2: Explore any unfinished business in Takayama. Possibly travel to Toyama in evening?

Day 13 5/3: Start in or travel to Toyama. ~~See firefly squid in am?~~ (already sold out). Return to Tokyo Via Alpine route.

Day 14-23 5/4-5/13: Tokyo. Pick up empty luggage to fill with shopping items. Overnight trip to Nikko at some point. Possible other overnight trip to Kusatsu or somewhere else interesting. Explore Tokyo.

\-Tokyo plans: Food and drink centric and exploring quirks. A handful of high end restaurants planned. Hoping for Ghibli museum reservations and will be probably see other museums as well. Near the end I plan to purchase a handful of Japanese whiskey and ceramics to take home as well. Possibly shop for some clothes as well.

And here are some follow up questions and concerns: 

\-Is Mount Yoshino still worth visiting in late April? Will I miss any picturesque reasons to be there?

\-Is the alpine route going to be completely overrun since I’ll be there on golden week holidays? Should I plan an overnight in Murodo to ease the schedule that day?

\-Is Takayama or Toyama a better place to stay overnight on day 12?

\-Are there any luxury ryokans that take single travelers? I have one booked for Kinosaki but am curious to visit others.

\-Do handmade ceramic vendors in Tokyo typically ship abroad? I have some concerns over weight and space.

Thanks in advance for any feedback, I'm booking it a bit last minute so I'm sure I'm missing some important details but I'm very excited to finally get out there!"

JapanTravel,Rough 3-week itinerary check March/April,"Finally going back to Japan! Been there in 2016 for 2 weeks, but didn't get much further than Tokyo, Osaka, Kyoto and Hiroshima/Miyajima. Did day trips to Nara and Nikko as well.

I'm coming in by ferry from Busan and I have a 3-week JR pass. My initial plan was hopping around Kyushu for a week first, but I'm travelling longer and a bit done with staying at certain places for only 1 or 2 nights. Want to take it a bit slower and doing more day trips :)

Tokyo at the end is just gonna be photographing, shopping and eating, so I'm not gonna make an itinerary for that. I've seen the main highlights of Tokyo already, but I love big cities and street photography so I'm basically gonna walk around for a few days.

The only ""rough"" travel day is the day I'm going from Takayama to Hakone, but honesly... I've had much worse days in Asia. I was gonna go to Nagoya initially and do a day trip to Hakone from Tokyo, but the main reason I wanted to go to Bagoya was the Ghibli Park and I don't have any tickets. Also didnt manage to get ticket for Ghibli Museum this morning, so fml...

Any suggestions for better routes or alternative day trip to do from the places I'm staying?

11.11 Nara overnight

Keep in mind that standalone posts in the subreddit must still adhere to the rules, and quick questions are only welcome here and in /r/JapanTravelTips.**

## Japan Entry Requirements and COVID Requirements

* Japan has resumed visa-free travel for [ordinary passport holders of 68 countries](https://www.mofa.go.jp/j_info/visit/visa/index.html) (countries listed [here](https://www.mofa.go.jp/j_info/visit/visa/short/novisa.html)).
* If you are a passport holder of a country **not** on the visa exemption list, you will still need to apply for a visa. All requirements are listed [on the official website](https://www.mofa.go.jp/j_info/visit/visa/index.html).
* Tourists need to have three doses of an [approved vaccine](https://www.mhlw.go.jp/stf/covid-19/border_vaccine.html) or submit [a negative COVID-19 test result](https://www.mhlw.go.jp/stf/covid-19/border_test.html) ahead of their departure to Japan. For the vaccine doses, there are no timing requirements as long as you have three doses of an approved vaccine (see [top of page 10 here](https://www.mhlw.go.jp/content/001002920.pdf)).
* Tourists entering Japan should get their COVID document checking process, Immigration process, and Customs process fast tracked by filling out [Visit Japan Web](https://vjw-lp.digital.go.jp/en/). This will generate a QR code for Immigration, a QR code for Customs, and a blue ""Review completed"" screen for COVID fast track (no QR code) once approved. (See below for more info.)
* Travelers connecting through Japanese airports and staying airside for their connection do not need to complete any visa, entry, or COVID procedures.

## Japan Tourism and Travel Updates

* Masks are still very prevalent both inside and outside while in Japan. The [current government recommendation until March 12, 2023](https://www.mhlw.go.jp/stf/covid-19/mask.html) is to wear masks both indoors and outdoors whenever in close proximity to other people or while talking to them. In practice, most people wear masks all of the time, and the majority of businesses require masks to enter the premises.
* **Starting on March 13, 2023, [mask usage will be up to personal choice and preferences](https://www.mhlw.go.jp/stf/covid-19/mask.html).** The government recommendation will only remain in place for medical institutions, nursing homes, and crowed buses/trains. That said, keep in mind that private establishments can still ask that you wear a mask to enter, and you should be respectful of those types of restrictions.
* Shops and restaurants often do temperature checks or require you to use hand sanitizer when entering a building, although you won’t typically be asked for any proof of vaccination.
* Some shops, restaurants, and attractions have reduced hours. We encourage you to double check the opening hours of the places you’d like to visit before arriving.
* There have been some permanent or extended closures of popular sights and attractions, including teamLab Borderless, Shinjuku Robot Restaurant, and Kawaii Monster Cafe. Check out [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/xqulaa/for_travelers_coming_to_japannew_and_gone/) for more detail.
* If you become ill while traveling, please see the instructions in [this guide](https://www.jnto.go.jp/emergency/eng/mi_guide.html) or contact the [COVID-19 Consultation Center by phone](https://www.c19.mhlw.go.jp/covid-19-en.html#contents04).

## Visit Japan Web Info and FAQs

[Visit Japan Web](https://vjw-lp.digital.go.jp/en/) (VJW) is an online document-checking system introduced in December 2022. It allows you to pre-enter all of your Immigration, Customs, and COVID vaccine/test information before arriving in Japan. To make the entry process as smooth as possible and prevent any issues, we recommend filling it out and obtaining the QR codes provided by the service.

Here are some frequently asked questions regarding filling out the VJW sections:

**Can I put multiple family members under the same Visit Japan Web account?**

&gt; All adults should have their own VJW account. Family members on the same account should only be either minors or dependents incapable of filling it out on their own.

**How far in advance can I fill out Visit Japan Web?**

&gt; Officially speaking, you can use Visit Japan Web for trips up until the end of the year following the current year. For instance, in February 2023, you can register a trip with a date up to December 2024. That said, your information will be wiped if you don't sign into Visit Japan Web at least once every 18 months.

&gt; Practically speaking, there's no real need to register more than a few months or weeks in advance, as the information gets reviewed and approved within hours or days.

**What flight number do I use?**

&gt; You should use the flight number for the flight _landing in Japan_. So, for instance, if you have a flight from New York City to Seattle and then from Seattle to Tokyo, you use the flight number of the Seattle to Tokyo Flight. If you are on a codeshare flight, you can use either the carrier you purchased through, or the operating carrier. For instance, if you are on American Airlines #4065 and it codeshares with JAL #001, you can write either ""AA 4065"" or ""JAL 001"".

**What do I put down for my intended address? What do I do if I'm staying in multiple hotels or accommodations over the course of my trip?**

&gt; You should use the address and contact information for your first hotel/hostel/Airbnb/etc. You don't need to provide multiple addresses.

**On the quarantine procedures page, it has a ""Time remaining to complete registration: XXXXXX"" notification, but I've already submitted my vaccine certificate and my screen is blue. What do I do?**

&gt; You don't have to do anything. This timer is for submitting a test for approval, which you don't need to do if you submitted vaccine information. Basically, it's bad design/programming.

Is there a place to leave bags or suitcases inside the park?

Would like to know how many days would be recommended. I assume 2 is sufficient? or 3?

Did anyone stay at the legoland resort or a different hotel nearby.

I assume there are some places to eat lunch inside the park?

Is Sea-Life Nagoya also worth a visit?

A lot of the details pertaining to picking up pocket-wifi and what stations to take to where were left out. I do have them on my detailed itinerary to give me a rough estimate of travel times.

I also want to thank the sub for giving me some great ideas!

This was a spur of the moment trip since I snagged the Noma Kyoto reservation, I plan on going back to Japan in August, 2023 for a longer amount of time without any time restrictions.

Will give a trip report when I get back."

My boyfriend and I are traveling to Japan for the first time (also our first time flying internationally) and we have already purchased the JR pass, however we are unsure how or where to get our passport stamped. Do we need to get it in advanced (before our flight)? do we get it the day of our flight before we fly out of the US? Or do we get our passport stamped after we land in Japan? If anyone has any insights or any information please let me know. Thank you so much"

JapanTravel,Itinerary Check - 27 Days East to West,"Hello,

I’m (30, M) heading to Japan for the first time next week (arriving 14th). I don’t usually have a solid plan before I get to a country but I’m realising you need to book up in advance in Japan so I’m putting together an itinerary. My plan is to start in Tokyo and head west to get the ferry to Korea, I plan to be in the country about 28 days. 

What I’m hoping for more than anything else is a really varied trip, seeing as many different sides of the country as possible, from the historic to the modern, religious to the nerdy, urban hustle to natural beauty. 

This is my plan so far, I still have a few maybes and I’m hoping for advice on if these are worth a visit - I want to see as much of the country as possible but I’d rather stay somewhere for two nights rather than one so I’m not constantly traveling. 

TOKYO - 6 Nights (booked this)
HAKONE - 1 night
FUJI FIVE LAKES - 2 nights

—(Nagano?)—

MATSUMOTO - 1 night
KANAZAWA - 2 nights
SHIRAKAWAGO - 1 night
TAKAYAMA - 2 nights
KYOTO - 4 nights (day trip to Nara)

—(Koyasan/Mount Koya?)—

OASKA (Super Nintendo World) - 3 nights

—(Himeji castle?)—

—(Naoshima Island?)—

KURASHIKI (canals) - 1 night
HIROSHIMA  - 3 nights (day trip to Miyajima Island)
FUKUOKA (ferry to Korea) - 1 night

Any advice very welcome!
- How is my trip going to line up with blossom season?
- Should I go to Nagano, Koyasan, Himeji castle, Naoshima Island?
- Is there anywhere I’m missing from my itinerary?
- Are there any places I can visit as a day trip from somewhere else?
- Am I spending too long/not enough in any one place?"

JapanTravel,eSIM or Physical,"Hello! I’m travelling in Japan for 2 months. I’ve done some research on SIMs and saw many people recommending eSIMS like ubigi. However, these people were travelling for a shorter time than me. Then those who talked about physical sims were people staying and working for at least a year. 
Since i’m kind of in the middle, I’m confused as to whether I should look for a physical SIM with the ability to call and text, as it seems eSIMS can’t do that. Will it really be necessary for a 2 month trip? Would an eSIM be enough? Do I need a phone number for this short period?

For context, the residence the school I’m studying at set me up in has pocket wifi. I don’t want to have to carry it around for two months, but I can text and FaceTime through wifi on that."

I on the other hand was able to take more days off and will have extra days in Japan to do some exploring but wanted to make sure that he too was able to see a lot of Japan. 

This is our very basic itinerary. As it stands the plan would be to ship our bags to our Ryokan in Hakone on the night of Day 2. On Day 3 we would explore the Lake Kawaguchi area/ Chureito Pagoda/ Mt Fuji panoramic ropeway and then stay the night in the ryokan in Hakone. Day 4 we would explore Hakone during the day and leave for Kyoto in the afternoon. 

I wondered if this sounded doable or if we should cut out the Mt Fuji area and stick to only exploring Hakone. Thank you!

My usual approach to travel is to have a list of must-sees based on research, determine where to stay based on that, arrange hotels and transportation, buy any necessary tickets ahead of time--then let the trip unfold. Definitely not a minute-by-minute planner; prefer to leave room for serendipity.
 
We both like anime. He's a gamer; I like history. We both like the outdoors.
 
I am a little nervous for this trip, so feedback on our itinerary is appreciated!

DAY NINE
Flight is late afternoon out of Haneda. Plan on spending some time at Tokyo station, as I've read there is a lot of shopping, etc.
 
You'll note we don't have a lot of food/dining picked out. We are both super adventurous eaters, so we plan on just going with the flow, other than in Hakone.

JapanTravel,Kyushu itinerary check,"  

We are very excited about our upcoming trip to Japan in July 2023. This is our second trip to Japan. We will spend the first 10 days between Tokyo, Nagoya, and Hiroshima. We will then head to Kyushu. This is going to be a one-way trip, as we will be returning to Tokyo by plane from Kagoshima. I made the following tentative itinerary for the Kyushu part of the trip and would very much appreciate your suggestions, critiques, and tweaks. 

Day 1 Shinkansen from Hiroshima to Fukuoka and night in Fukuoka

Day 2 Fukuoka Morning : Shinkansen to Nanzo-In temple and reclining Buddha

Afternoon: walk around Fukuoka and discover the city, night in Fukuoka

Day 3 Shinkansen to Nagasaki, visit Atomic bomb museum and park, night in Nagasaki

Day 4 Day in Nagasaki 

Day 5 Rent car, visit Okawachiyama  and Yutoku Inari-jinja and spend the night in Saga area ***(or is it better to go back to Nagasaki for the night and then travel to Kurokawa by taking the ferry to Kumamoto?)***

Day 6 Drive to Kurokawa Onsen and relax **(*****I read that there is an agreement between Kurokawa ryokans that visitors can spend every night in a different ryokan and they will move the luggage for you. Has anybody experienced this?)***

Day 7 trip to Mt Aso from Kurokawa Onsen, night in Kurokawa Onsen

Day 8 trip to Takachiho gorge from Kurokawa Onsen ***(should I spend a third night in Kurokawa or stay in Takachiho for the night?)***

Day 9 Drive to Kirishima park and spend the night there ***(is it worth making a stopover in Kumamoto on the way or even spending the night there?)*** 

Day 10 Day at Kirishima park (hiking, bathing) and night there 

Day 11 Ferry to Sakurajima, spend the night there 

Day 12 Head to Ibisuki and Satsuma peninsula and spend the night ***(is it*** ***worth going there or shall I take one more day on Sakurajima or Yakushima)***

Day 13 Head back to Kagoshima and take the ferry to Yakushima ***(shall I leave the car in Kagoshima and rent another one in Yakushima, so I avoid transporting the car on the ferry?)***

Day 14 + Day 15 Yakushima

Day 16 Ferry back to Kagoshima

Day 17 Plane to Tokyo

***General question: are there great places that we missed in this itinerary? Are there places where we should spend more / less time?***

Thank you very much in advance for your suggestions!"

JapanTravel,Day Trip Recommendations,"My wife and I are planning to visit Japan April 16 - May 1. 

4/16 - Fly into Narita 
4/21 - Train to Kyoto
4/26 - Train to Hiroshima
4/27 - Ferry to Miyajima for Ryokan night
4/28 - Train to Osaka
5/1 - Fly out of KIX 

I currently think it makes sense it only buy the 7-day JR pass and activate the day we leave Kyoto. 

My wife and I are most interested in nature, architecture, history, and food. 

There are so many dang options for day trips during our Kyoto stay and we’re having a brutal time choosing where to go. Thinking explore Kyoto for 2-3 days and planning to take a day trip to possibly Kobe and Nara. But I’ve also read how a visit to Ine fishing village seems awesome, Kanazawa, Omi-Hachiman, etc. 

Might make sense to save Kobe for while we’re in Osaka? Won’t have JR pass, but is closer/cheaper. 

Any other recommendations on what should be added/removed?"

I currently have reservations at a hotel in Yotsuya (Tokyo stay Yotsuya), Akihabara (APA Akihabara Ekimae) and Jimbocho (APA Kanda-Jimbocho). They're all 5-ish minutes from a train station and similar prices, except for the Jimbocho hotel that's about ~100 USD cheaper.

We plan on spending 4 days in Tokyo before moving on to Osaka. We love food and nightlife in general, and plan on spending a lot of time on the west side in terms of sightseeing. Where would you stay?"

JapanTravel,Itinerary check - Tokyo/Hakone/Kyoto/Osaka 2 adults 1 toddler on 28/03-28-04,"We’ve looked through quite a bit of really inspiring and thorough itineraries on JapanTravel already (and we are aware that going with a toddler is controversial) but we know little of Japan in advance and planning a trip like this can feel overwhelming. Any tips/feedback is welcome.

We are bringing lots of things for the kid from home (food, medicine, diapers, travel stroller, carrier)

We are trying to leave things pretty open and with plenty of time. But having a hard time deciding which places to visit and how much time to spend in each. We are starting out in Tokyo and right now the plan is:
7 days in Tokyo (Ueno)
3 days in Hakone
8 days in Kyoto
7 days in Osaka
7 days in Tokyo

We are trying not to make strict daily agendas and instead to explore specific areas.

We are looking at hotels/airbnb currently and are leaning towards hotels with a simple double bed and some basic kitchen appliances. We hope to manage accomodation for 20-30.000 JPY/day. Right now we are looking on stuff like booking(dot)com - is this the best approach or are there better places to find accomodation?

In terms of transit between cities, I’ve come to understand that JR pass is probably not recommendable for our use case and we should instead buy single tickets for Shinkansen instead.

We are hoping to find a ryokan with a private onsen while in Hakone.

In Kyoto we would like to bike around, if we manage to find a bile with a kids seat.

We would specifically like feedback on:
1. The timeline and amount of time in each destination.
2. Where/what platform to book accomodations
3. Have we understood the single ticket vs JR pass for transit correctly
4. Can you only do luggage forwarding in hotels?

Thank you in advance and for a high quality travel subreddit."

My girlfriend and I will be visiting Japan from 23 Mar until 8 Apr, right in time for sakura season.

Our itinerary:

## Thu Mar 23 - Arrival

* Arrive in Tokyo Narita airport around 6pm. Immigration. Will do Visit Japan registration beforehand.
* Train to hotel near Ueno station.
* Small meal near station and rest.

## Fri Mar 24 - Tokyo A1

* Pokemon Center Tokyo DX. If too crowded, something around it.
* teamLab Planets TOKYO. Reserved a spot around noon.

* Final Fantasy Eorzea Cafe. In the evening. Reserved. We are both FF fans and it looks fun.

* Booked a guide for the day to take us to some nice places there. Via Aviator.

## Wed Apr 5 - Tokyo B2

## Thu Apr 6 - Tokyo B3

* Meiji Jingu. In the morning.

## Fri Apr 7 - Tokyo B4

## Fri Apr 7 - Tokyo B5

JapanTravel,Itinerary check- 7 days in Tokyo in May,"Hey y’all! I’m making my first ever trip to a non-English speaking country and I’m gonna be doing it solo. I have a lot of anxiety about the whole thing but I’ve done some planning and research for months to prepare myself for this. However I don’t have much trust in my itinerary planning skills since before this I’ve only ever gone on trips planned by other people. I’m hoping each day to stick to one area to avoid having to pay for and take public transit multiple times throughout each day. 

Day 1

• arrive mid-day in Tokyo at Hotel near Tokyo station 

•unpack at hotel and then take the train to Ueno

• spend the rest of the evening chilling in Ueno park and going to Ueno zoo 


Day 2

• head to Ikebukuro 

• stop by Animate store near Ikebukuro station 

• Sunshine Dori

• Otome Road

• check out a couple themed cafes in the area 

• Sunshine city/aquarium 

• go back to hotel near 


Day 3

• take train to Asakusa 

• explore the multiple shopping streets 

• visit gardens and shrines

• find some places to relax and draw sights 


Day 4

•head to Akihabara 

•spend the day visiting anime and electronic stores all throughout the area

•hit up some cat and maid cafes

•visit a couple shrines in the area towards the end of the day 


Day 5

•go to Shibuya 

•spend the day shopping in Shibuya and then taking some time in Yoyogi park 

•spend the evening visiting Nakano broadway and then going over to Kichijoji 

(I’m aware Kichijoji is not IN Shibuya I just want to go visit Kichijoji during the same day) 


Day 6 (still not too sure about this one)

•spend the day visiting and shopping in Shinjuku (not at night, I’m not interested in whatever goes on there at night) 

•spend other half of the day visiting Harajuku 


Day 7

This one I’m still not too sure about. I’d love to take suggestions as to what other areas of Tokyo I should go to. My first idea was to spend time in the parks around the Imperial Palace I’m Chiapas but I figure that may not take me all day and I’ll want to spend the evening somewhere else 

I’d really appreciate any feedback and suggestions, especially for the later days where I’m a bit more iffy about my plans. Things such as stores or restaurants that may not be as well known or any nice sightseeing locations in these areas to check out. I’m also always looking for suggestions of places to relax in these areas I visit as I know I’ll get tired of walking around and will want to rest"

JapanTravel,16 days in Japan from Osaka (Round trip) advice,"I will be going to Japan with my boyfriend this spring. He has been to Japan before (Kansai region, Tokyo, Kiso Valley, Hiroshima and Miyajima), whereas it is my first time in Japan. So we are trying to find a balance between the main sites of interest for me as well as new places for him. We have pre-booked all accommodation up until Tokyo. We're unsure whether we should skip a couple of towns, depending on the rail passes or regional passes we are considering. 

We definitely want to see Mt. Fuji and do the Tateyama Kurobe Alpine Route. The route only opens from 15th April, which is why we structured the itinerary this way. 

&amp;#x200B;

* **Osaka: 5 nights** (4/04 - 9/04) \[4 full days and *2 half days*\]
   * Kyoto was too expensive to stay in, we plan on taking day trips to Kyoto and Nara
   * Maybe use the Kansai Thru Pass?
* **Tokyo: 3 nights** (travel on 9/04, stay 9/04 - 12/04)
   * Arrive in Tokyo after noon via Nozomi shinkansen; leave Tokyo in the morning for Hakone
* **Hakone: 1 Night**  (12/04 - 13/04)
   * Buy the Fuji Hakone Pass 
* **Fuji Five Lakes: 2 nights** (13/04 - 15/04)
   * Stay in Fujisan
   * Visit Chureito Pagoda, Lake Yamanakako, Oshino Hakkai, and Hida no Sato (or if too much a selection of these areas)
   * On 15th, travel from Otsuki to Matsumoto (1.5h to 3.5 depending on train line)
* **Matsumoto: 1 night** (15/04 - 16/04)
   * Visit the castle and city (not so interested tbh but because it is near to the alpine route and we want to start early)
* **Alpine route (full day) + Toyama: 1 night** (16/04-17/04)
   * From Matsumoto to Shinano-Omachi (JR Oito 1h), one of the possible starts of the route
   * Alpine Route (9h) (on 16/04) to ending in Toyama
   * Sleep in Toyama (because of the train timetables, I believe we would be forced to sleep in Toyama)
* **Takayama: 1 night** or **day trip from Toyama or Kanazawa** (17/04 - 18/04)
* **Kanazawa: 1 night** (18/04 - 19/04)
* **Osaka: 1 night** (19/04 - 20/04) 

After some researching, we think that the most economical pass to have would be the **Takayama-Hokuriku Area Tourist Pass**. We're having doubts on whether or not we should skip Hakone (and then add a night in Shinano-Omachi or elsewhere in the route in Kanazawa or Takayama). If we remove Hakone, then it would be possible to visit Shirakawago I think. If we skip Hakone, we are considering the **Mt. Fuji and Five Lakes Passport**.

Another pass we were considering for the itinerary would be the **Alpine-Takayama-Matsumoto Area Tourist Pass (includes the Alpine ticket)**, but then we would skip Kanazawa altogether, returning from Takayama to Osaka via Nagoya. 

The shinkansen from Osaka to Tokyo is also another point we're concerned about because it's expensive and we want to avoid the night bus. We have been on night buses before elsewhere, but the buses don't seem to be that comfortable in Japan. The luxury buses don't seem to have an edge because of the price. We'd rather pay a little bit more to take the shinkansen. The flights on 04/09 are too expensive and almost equivalent to the shinkansen after taking into consideration the transportation costs to the airport. 

But I'm wondering if there's actually a pass that's more economical than the two rail passes we're considering here, which would better cover our itinerary especially since we want to take the Nozomi shinkansen to Tokyo. I doubt the 7 or 14-day JR Rail Pass is worth it though because of how our itinerary is structured...(also because it does not include the Alpine route ticket which we want to see). 

So in sum:

1. Is it worth it to see **both** Hakone and Mt. Fuji? Should we drop Hakone?
2. Is it worth it to see **both** Kanazawa and Takayama? Should we drop one, and if so which?
3. Is there a more economical pass or options that would cover our itinerary? 
4. Also, for the Kansai region (Osaka, Kyoto, Nara) is it worth it to take a regional pass like the Kansai Thru Pass?"

JapanTravel,Need advice - where to seek help for trouble during early pregnancy,"(TW for pregnancy loss)

Hey all, hoping for some advice on my situation. For some context, I had a miscarriage in November of last year at 11.5 weeks. I won't go into too much detail but there were a few warning signs that were not acted on and I ended up being admitted to hospital for a couple of days after suffering a haemorrhage. I found out a few days ago I'm pregnant again, about 6 weeks as of Tuesday.

Even before baby no.1 I had plans to travel to Japan from 26th March to 19th April. I'm travelling with a friend (husband is staying in the UK) and we'll be looping around the country, starting and ending in Tokyo, and hitting up Hakone, Kyoto, Hiroshima/Miyajima, Osaka, Kanazawa and Takeyama.

I just did the maths and now getting anxious as I've realised I will still be in Japan at the same point of my pregnancy where I lost it last time. 

So my questions are: what is the general protocol for treating problems during early pregnancy? Is it something that would be 'acceptable' to call an ambulance for or would I need to find a doctor myself? If so, what is the best way to find a doctor that can treat this kind of problem?

Thanks in advance for any advice!"

I am an avid photographer and hiker so I'm hoping to chase sakura and see some of Japan's wilderness. We have a JR pass from day 5-18 and a Fuji Pass for 19-21. I'm really unsure of how much we move around between Kanazawa and Fuji, so advice there would be appreciated. Thanks for your help!

&amp;#x200B;

Day 12: Osaka. No plans, rest up for tomorrow.

Day 13: Spend the day hiking the pilgrimage trail up Koyasan and spend the night at a temple.

Day 14: Koyasan to Kyoto. We'll see how soon we want to leave Koyasan in the am or if we want to get back to Kyoto to see something we felt we missed. However, try to leave Kyoto early tomorrow.

Day 15: Kyoto to Kanazawa. Prioritize seeing Kanazawa.

Day 16: Kanazawa to Takayama with a midday stop in Shirakawago. Stay in Takayama.

This will be my first trip to japan with my family and would like seek opinions and ideas on day trips from Osaka for the first 4 days. Currently looking at Kobe and Nara, but would like to see if there are other day trips that the community have in mind.

Additionally, would also like to ask if there are places that is a must visit when visiting this region. I have a list of the famous places to visit in Kyoto (e.g. Fushimi Inari, Kinkaku-ji, Kiyozumi-dera, Arashiyama, etc)

Many thanks in advance!"

JapanTravel,Travel during Golden Week,"Hi everyone! I was hoping to get some trip recommendations- I want to travel locally during Golden Week but am not really sure where would be the best place to go. I have already been to Kansai twice. I’m not looking for anything specific to do mainly just sight seeing and experiencing a new area in Japan. I was considering Hokkaido but not really sure where else would be a good idea. I live in Tokyo- trying not to overspend on transport! 

Thank you in advance!"
JapanTravel,"6th Trip to Japan, 32 days - Need Advice.","My partner and I have been 5 times to Japan and have booked flights for this year, 6th October - 8th November.

Previously our trips were as follows:

1: Osaka/Kyoto (1 Week)

2: Okinawa/Miyakojima/IshigakiJima/Osaka/Kinosaki Onsen/Takayama/Kanazawa/Himeji/Tokyo (4 Weeks)

3: Hokkaido (Shiretoko/Kushiro/Lake Akan/Obihiro/Sapporo/Otaru/Asahikawa/Tokyo (2.5 Weeks)

4: Kyushu (Fukuoka/Kumamoto/Unzen/Nagasaki/Karatsu/Kagoshima/Mount Aso/Miyazaki/Yakushima/Amamioshima/Miyazaki (5 Weeks)

5. Aomori/Hachinohe/Tokyo/Izu Peninsula/Nagoya/Onomichi/Shiminamikaido/Osaka/Kyoto

It's hard to decide where to go as so many places are appealing, especially with the luxury of 32 days as the possibilities are almost endless.

Food is really important, we also love exploring cities, going out and meeting people, cycling, hiking, onsens, nature, museums etc.

We’d ideally like a mix of big city, countryside, volcanos, mountains, villages and beautiful coastal areas and are happy to get JR Rail Passes and hire cars for short periods when necessary.

I speak basic Japanese, badly but enough to be useful and allow us to be unstressed being in areas with no English.

Current ideas after lots of research:

**Option 1** 

Hokkaido (Sapporo, Shikotsu-Toya, Noboribetsu, Hakodate) - 8 Days

Tohoku (Morioka/Hachimentai/Nyuto Onsen/Kakunodate, Sendai/Matsushima) - 7 days

Chubu (Toyama/Kanazawa, Matsumoto, Kurobe Gorge.) - 7 Days

Kyoto/Nara/Ise-Shima - 6 Days

Tokyo - 4 Days

**Option 2**

Hokkaido (Sapporo, Shikotsu-Toya, Noboribetsu, Hakodate) - 8 Days

Tohoku (Morioka/Hachimentai/Nyuto Onsen) - 4 days

Chubu (Toyama/Kanazawa, Matsumoto, Kiso Valley ) - 7 Days

Kii Peninsula (Ise-Shima, Kumano Kodo, Coastline) - 6 Days

Kyoto/Nara - 3 Days

Tokyo - 4 Days

**Option 3**

Hokkaido (Sapporo, Shikotsu-Toya, Noboribetsu, Hakodate) - 8 Days

Tohoku (Morioka/Hachimentai/Nyuto Onsen/Kakunodate, Sendai/Matsushima) - 7 days

Niigata (Niigata, Sado Island, Hoshitoge) - 5 Days

Chubu (Toyama, Matsumoto, Kiso Valley) - 6 Days

Tokyo, Nikko - 6 Days

**Option 4**

Hokkaido (Sapporo, Shikotsu-Toya, Noboribetsu, Hakodate) - 8 Days

Tohoku (Morioka/Hachimentai/Nyuto Onsen/Kakinodate, Sendai/Matsushima, Yamadera, Ginzan Onsen etc.) - 12 days

Fukushima (Ouchijuku, Bandai, Fukushima) - 4 Days

Tokyo, Nikko - 8 Days

We were originally considering Shikoku plus Hiroshima which look amazing but thought that considering the time we will be there, North/East Japan makes more sense and we should leave Shikoku for a later November trip. No idea if that's the best move.

I'm grateful for any advice on narrowing things down, completely different suggestions also welcome.

Thanks in advance."

&amp;#x200B;

**Main questions**

Do I need to reserve Shinkansen tickets in advance? If so, can I get tickets with a flexible departure time or does it have to be a specific time?

Do I need to reserve Sagano Scenic Railway tickets in advance?

I'm leaning towards not getting the JR pass. It's difficult to determine whether it would save us money or not. I think it probably would save a little if we were strict about always using JR options. But I think that some of the trips might have better options that are not JR. Am I making the right choice?

&amp;#x200B;

**Other questions**

Omoide Yokocho -- how should we go about choosing places for food and drinks here?

Imperial Palace -- we won't be doing a guided tour, just looking from the outside. Aside from looking at it and getting a nice photo of the famous bridge, is there anything else we should be sure to do?

Is it worth spending a few hours at SkyTree? If we finish up there around dinner time what should we do for dinner? Something in the SkyTree or Asakusa area? Or Hoppy Street? Is Hoppy Street worthwhile? Or go back to Shinjuku? 

Do you have any dinner or nightlife recommendations in Shinjuku?

How do we go about finding and booking a private karaoke room? I'm sure there are places all over, but I'd have no idea how to choose one, or which ones would be more welcoming to English-speaking guests.

Odaiba -- any dinner recommendations in the area?

Saturday -- I made Saturday less structured because we are meeting friends and that will be the priority. Depending on how the time works out before and after seeing them, we'd like to visit some sights in Shinjuku, Shibuya, or Harajuku. How should we prioritize these sights?

Do you have any recommendations for tattoo-friendly bath houses in Shinjuku or any of the areas mentioned?

Themed cafes/bars -- maids, cats, muscle girls, etc? Which ones are worthwhile?

&amp;#x200B;

JapanTravel,"Recommendations: day trips from Tokyo, and a third 'base' after Tokyo/Kyoto/Osaka","Hi folks, I'm travelling solo to Japan for the entire month of June 2023 (rainy season, but I actually don't mind the rain!) Here is my very rough itinerary so far:

1st-18th - Tokyo (the reason I'm staying here so long is because I have the first 3 weekends earmarked for meeting friends who live in Tokyo). Planning on exploring Tokyo at a fairly leisurely pace, soaking up city life, etc. It also gives me time for day trips!

19th-24th (ish) - Kyoto, with day trips to Nara and Osaka. I might also stop off at Kakegawa for a few hours on the way to Kyoto because I really like tea.

25th-28th - ???

Back to Tokyo on the 28th, the 29th for last little bits and departure on the morning of the 30th.

As you can see the itinerary is very rough currently. The main things I'd like recommendations for are:

* Day trips that I can take relatively spontaneously from Tokyo - I have Mt Takao earmarked already but would like a few options to choose from depending on how tired I am
* Somewhere to base myself for the last portion of the trip. Looking through the sub lots of people go to Hiroshima/Miyajima but I'm just wondering if anyone knows any hidden gems or underrated places which will provide a nice contrast with the places I already have on the itinerary? Region wise I think anywhere aside from Kyushu and Hokkaido would \*probably\* be doable (if you think the idea of travelling from Kyoto to Tohoku is terrible please say so, with the Shinkansen being so fast I have no idea what's considered a reasonable distance for one day)

A bit about me and what I like to do:

* I speak Japanese at around N4 level so I'm not restricted to places where people speak English. Actually I would like to practice my Japanese :)
* I enjoy time in nature. I like walks and gentle hikes but not so keen on anything super strenuous/mountain climbing etc. Within Tokyo and Kyoto the kinds of things I'm thinking of doing relating to nature include visiting parks and shrine forests, enjoying the hydrangeas in bloom, the iris festival, and a day trip to Mt Takao from Tokyo.
* I'm looking forward to eating lots of Japanese food and trying local/regional specialities, especially the weird and wonderful. I also work in a tea shop and love trying different kinds of tea so I'd like to do a tea ceremony at some point during the trip. 
* I'm also interested in cultural things such as festivals, shrines, arts and crafts etc. I like the occasional museum but not constantly going to them. I'm not looking to go to any theme parks.
* I would be keen to go along to any seasonally specific events in June, though I'm aware it's the rainy season - if you know anywhere that has festivals/special exhibitions etc please let me know!
* Within my energy levels I consider anywhere within a 90min radius by public transport to be day-trippable.
* Generally I'm quite happy to be a bit spontaneous!

Thanks if you can help - much appreciated!"

14-28 April 
10-24 May

Which one can be the less crowded and nice to visit Tokyo + Kyoto (lots of gardens, daily trips to nearby locations)?

- There appears to have been a direct bus that is no longer running.

JapanTravel,20 days itinerary // July 2023 // looking for changes in my plan due to heat,"Hi Guys

I posted my itinerary already a year ago but unfortunately I couldn't go then (thanks covid). But this year I'm gonna do my trip. The thing is last year I planned for May/early June, but due to me starting to study now I can only go July. And since Japan gets extremely hot in those month I got a bit worried. I'm still going to do the trip I just want to have some ideas or a backup plan in case I can't stand the heat.

What I had in mind for my original trip:

**Tokyo 5 days**

Fly from Zurich to Tokyo

Hotel or Airbnb in Shinjuku

Shopping, Food etc.

Day trip to Nikko and start of my 14 days JR Pass

Exploring the temples in Nikko

**Fuji Five Lakes / Kawaguchi 3 days**

Take loads of photos and maybe even climb mt Fuji

**Kyoto 4 days**

Just explore the city and visit some temples. Visit the imperial castle and maybe visiting the manga museum, Nishiki Market etc. Like I said, most things to do I will chose spontaneously.

**Osaka 3 days**

The food will definitely be a highlight here. Universal Studios, Market, temples etc.

**Nara daytrip**

Rent a bike and explore the city. Visit some temples and see some deers...

**Hiroshima 2 days**

Visit the Peace Park.

**Miyajima Island daytrip**

Just explore the Island

**Back to Tokyo for 1 night**

Flight back to Zurich

I am extremely flexible (except for the 5 days in Tokyo since I've already booked those.) and my trip is actually gonna be a bit longer so I can add some days to wherever I want.

Heat related Backup plans:

I had some ideas for example changing my second part of the trip to visit the Japanese Alps since the weather there should be a little milder.

An other idea was to visit one of the tropical islands to get some beach days which will make the heat a lot more bearable.

I could also go to Hokkaido since it should be way less hot there and the flower season makes this also attractive. Of course I would have to change most of my plan than which wouldn't be a big problem. The only downside is, I'm not planning to rent a car and I've read that the public transport isn't great on Hokkaido.

What do you guys think? Do you have any recommendations or secret tips on what to do during the hot summers in Japan?"

&amp;#x200B;

**Tokyo 5 days**

Fly from Zurich to Tokyo

Hotel or Airbnb in Shinjuku

Shopping, Food etc.

Day trip to Nikko and start of my 14 days JR Pass

Exploring the temples in Nikko

**Fuji Five Lakes / Kawaguchi 3 days**

Take loads of photos and maybe even climb mt Fuji

**Kyoto 4 days**

Just explore the city and visit some temples. Visit the imperial castle and maybe visiting the manga museum, Nishiki Market etc. Like I said, most things to do I will chose spontaneously.

**Osaka 3 days**

The food will definitely be a highlight here. Universal Studios, Market, temples etc.

**Nara daytrip**

Rent a bike and explore the city. Visit some temples and see some deers...

**Hiroshima 2 days**

Visit the Peace Park.

**Miyajima Island daytrip**

Just explore the Island

**Back to Tokyo for 1 night**

Flight back to Zurich

&amp;#x200B;

I am extremely flexible (except for the 5 days in Tokyo since I've already booked those.) and my trip is actually gonna be a bit longer so I can add some days to wherever I want.

Heat related Backup plans:

I had some ideas for example changing my second part of the trip to visit the Japanese Alps since the weather there should be a little milder.

An other idea was to visit one of the tropical islands to get some beach days which will make the heat a lot more bearable.

I could also go to Hokkaido since it should be way less hot there and the flower season makes this also attractive. Of course I would have to change most of my plan than which wouldn't be a big problem. The only downside is, I'm not planning to rent a car and I've read that the public transport isn't great on Hokkaido.

&amp;#x200B;

What do you guys think? Do you have any recommendations or secret tips on what to do during the hot summers in Japan?"

JapanTravel,Recommendations that aren't shrines/temples?,"Planning a trip for about 16 days early to mid May, &amp; getting the JR Pass - no car. Not too interested in shrines or temples as I've seen quite a few, and we're from Asia so that aspect isn't very new to us.

Interests are geared towards: museums, culture, scenery, activities (unfortunately not hiking as it's a family trip and some have knee issues :/), and general interesting/curious/quirky stuff that you don't really see elsewhere. For museums etc, they'd have to be English-friendly for our group.

So far on the itinerary:

Tokyo (approx 5-6 days including day trips):
- Senso-ji, maybe rent a 👘 
- Shinjuku Gyoen
- Yoyogi, Harajuku, Shibuya
- National Museum 
- Starbucks Reserve Roastery??
- Walk along places like Ueno Park, Meguro River, Akihabara
- Any recs for interesting neighbourhoods etc to walk around in?

Other fun activities in Tokyo? I looked at TeamLabs, but not sure if it's really worthwhile as I've seen digital art installations before.

Day trips:
- Ashikaga Flower Park
- Lake Kawaguchi

Osaka (1 day):
- Universal Studios
Any fun things to *do* here? We've ruled out the castle

Kyoto (1 day):
- Kiyomizu-dera
- Fushimi Inari
- Silver Pavilion
- Walk around some old streets

Himeji Castle &amp; garden (1 day)

Hiroshima (1 day):
- Ferry to Miyajima &amp; island shrine
- Atom Bomb Dome
- Museum
- Try some oysters and local beer

Kyushu (3-4 days incl travel):
Mt Aso:
- Caldera &amp; museum
- Kusasenri

Beppu:
- Hells
- Sand baths + onsen

Any other recs in Kyushu? Food too? Other than the raw meat 😅

Not sure if we could fit in Hokkaido, most probably only a day trip to Hakodate if we have a spare day in Tokyo. Any other off the beaten path areas to visit?

Essentially we're looking for culture, history, etc but also fun things to do, as my worry is that just walking around looking at things for 16 days might get dull. Hence the inclusion of more interactive stuff like USJ, kimono, sand baths, etc. The only other thing I can think of would be a sake brewery tour, but any other suggestions or general input would be helpful.

Thanks!"

JapanTravel,Itinerary check: Kyushu (1 week),"I'm heading to Fukuoka in a few weeks and am getting a bit overwhelmed. I want to spend a month in Japan and think about spending a week in Kyushu. Because I'm already travelling getting the JR pass is a bit tricky, so I came up with the following using the regional Kyushu pass.

(March)

24 arriving in Fukuoka

Probably hit up a place for some local food, I heard Fukuoka is famous for ramen

25 Fukuoka

This will be my first full day in Japan. Granted, I'm not dying to see Fukuoka but figured I spend a day here anyway as this is the town I'm arriving in.

26 Nagasaki (activate 5-day pass)

Considering it's history as a trade port I want to dive into this town a bit further. 

27 Nagasaki 

Spend another day hitting up museums and just generally exploring.

28 to Kumamoto 

I read it's nice. Not sure if it's really a must-see though. If I'm better off just passing through or heading somewhere else let me know.

29 Aso for hike and onwards to Beppu

I think with an early start from Kumamoto I'd be able to do a hike here before catching an onward train to Beppu. I can do an overnight here but I'd rather spend a full day in Beppu.

30 Beppu

I looked into Kurakawa Onsen but I think that's not suitable for a day trip from Kumamoto/Aso. An overnight is unfortunately out of my budget. I'm thinking a day around Beppu might be a suitable alternative.

31 towards Hiroshima

I think I'll head on to Honshu after this. Although I think the Kunisaki peninsula may be worth checking out.

------------

I originally thought about checking out the Shimibara peninsula for onsen (Unzen), and then head to Kumamoto from there by ferry. Maybe this is a worthwhile daytrip from Nagasaki? Considering the 5 day Kyushu pass I should be able to squeeze in a day between Nagasaki and Kumamoto and still be able to travel to Beppu on the pass.

Any thoughts on this? Are there any other destinations I'm missing out on? This is my first trip to Japan.

Thanks!!"

We have been to Tokyo previously, and my wife can read Japanese (but not speak it as well). We go to conventions in the USA every year, multiple times a year.  
  
We were planning our itinerary and saw that AnimeJapan is happening the weekend we’ll be in Tokyo, and we’re very interested in going for the Saturday it opens. We know the crowds are insane, so we’re not very worried about that. However, we have never been to a large scale event like that in Japan and was curious if anyone else may have gone or experienced something similar. We would like to go, but we also think it may be overwhelming despite our experience with events. If anyone has first hand experience or advice, I’d appreciate any info or recommendations!"

Does anyone have any experience doing this and know of any kinds of places where i could maybe rent an office space with a door for an hour and wifi, in the tokyo and kyoto areas?

JapanTravel,Itinerary help - 9 days in Kyushu or Hokkaido?!,"Hello! 

We (meaning my boyfriend and I, a couple in our mid 20s) are traveling to Japan from Los Angeles for 14 days in mid August, and are torn between spending time in Kyushu or Hokkaido. We are looking to do **4 days in Tokyo and then 9ish days in either Hokkaido or Kyushu**. Both of us have been to Japan previously and did the Tokyo/Kyoto/Osaka trip before, so we are looking to spend some time off the proverbial beaten path in Japan this time around. We love hiking in mountainous terrain and by the coast (though not super technical), being outdoors generally, finding hole in the wall good food / drink / coffee spots. We're also looking to spend some time in onsens (though not every single day), and visiting local points of interest that may include shrines, monuments, etc. However, we're not huge on historical items, museums, aquariums and things of that nature. 

I've mapped out 2 potential itineraries for Kyushu / Hokkaido, either of which we would be renting a car, but would love some advice on which place would be more suited for having a variety of the aforementioned activities, and especially food (primarily seafood)! I'm worried that in Kyushu we'll be visiting so many onsen towns that we may be ...onsen-ed out? (if that's even possible), without many attractions to visit in the smaller towns. Both islands look gorgeous and a wonderful experience, but we only have so much time this trip around. Any suggestions on modifying either itinerary based on your experiences would be very much appreciated too, and/or if these seem too aggressive, but did research to try to limit driving time between places and cut down on other cities.  

Thank you so much in advance! 

**Tentative Kyushu Itin:** 

\- Day 1-3: Fukuoka  (home base) + day trips to neighboring towns such as Dazaifu, Itoshima, Mojiko Retro, or Takeo (*Which of these are worth visiting??)*  
\- Day 4: Beppu (home base) + Yufuin  
\- Day 5: Kumamoto (home base)  
\- Day 6: Takachiho Gorge day trip   
\- Day 7: Mount Aso + transit to Kurokawa for onsen  
\- Day 8-9: Kagoshima (home base) + day trips to Ibusuki or Sakurajima (*I know this is a long drive time...considering cutting out?)*

**Tentative Hokkaido Itin:**   
\- Day 1-2: Sapporo (Home base)   
\- Day 3: Otaru day trip   
\- Day 4: Shakotan peninsula + Cape Kamui day trip   
\- Day 5: Noboribetsu   
\- Day 6-7: Lake Toya   
\- Day 8-9: Hakodate"

Or if people have been to it before think it's even worth attending.

Current itinerary is Tokyo &gt; 1 week Kyoto Tue-Tue &gt; 1 week Osaka

The options I have are the following:

1) Stay in Tokyo until the AnimeJapan is over on the weekend and then head to Osaka. Effectively skipping Kyoto. Though can of course go to Kyoto from Osaka the amount of days lost originally in Kyoto would be quite a lot.

2) Go to Kyoto on from Tokyo for 4 days then on the weekend(saturday) take the JR back to Tokyo for AnimeJapan about a 3 hour ride then back to Kyoto another 3 hour ride. 

Benefit of this is JR Pass is then worth it and keep my full 1 week hotel stay in Kyoto already made. Plus not having to move luggage at all.

3) Cancel my Kyoto reservations and book a new ones for 4 days, then go to Tokyo, book weekends and monday in Tokyo, then travel over to Osaka on Tuesday. 

Same as the second one JR Pass is worth it, but this requires moving around luggage or storing it somewhere.

I will be Osaka for another week, but doing some remote work so don't really count it as full vacation style days as time is very limited during then. Plus I was already hoping to use it to go see other cities in the area as there's a lot to do in the Kansai region in my opinion."

JapanTravel,Preliminary Itinerary Review,"Hi everyone! 

I'm leaving for Japan this Saturday and will be there from March 12th until April 17th. I finally sat down and layed out a rough schedule today, could you guys give me some advice about my pathing?

March 12th - 17th stay in Tokyo

March 18th - March 20th stay in Nagoya

March 21st - March 26th stay in Kyoto

March 27th - March 30th stay in Osaka

March 31st - April 2nd do the Shinanami Kaido

April 3rd travel to Sasebo to meet a friend

April 5th - April 9th stay in Fukuoka

April 10th - April 13th stay in Hiroshima

April 14th - 17th stay in Tokyo

It's pretty jam packed and I was wondering if I should cut any cities out;/ adjust days spent in some cities. I don't really have any activities planned yet but I absolutely want to do the Shininami Kaido and visit my friend at Sasebo. I would appreciate any advice or things to do, thank you all!"

JapanTravel,"Planning my travel, have a few questions on some unclear points","Hello and thank you for your help! I will be traveling to Japan for my first time from April 2-21. So far all I have ""planned"" is I booked a hostel for my first 5 nights in Tokyo. I'm not great at planning, and while I feel pretty comfortable/confident in my ability to ""go with the flow"" while traveling, I do want to be prepared at least as best I can.

A few questions:
1) JR rail pass - I know there are posts about this all the time, but I just want to validate that I can buy one from an ""unofficial"" or third-party site and that it's perfectly ok? I hear it's cheaper to do it that way... for some reason? Would love a recommendation for a site and why, or maybe they're all the same?
2) Landing in Narita - I know the other airport is closer to Tokyo, but I didn't know when I booked my tickets, so that's ok. My question is if I'm planning on spending 5 days in Tokyo, should I wait to activate my JR pass until after those days? I might be able to get away with a 14-day rail pass instead of a 21-day rail pass by condensing most of my travel to when I'm not in Tokyo. Am I able to delay activating it like that?
3) Booking places to stay - I'm still trying to figure out an itinerary... I would like to get some nature time, and plan on soaking up the presence of Mt. Fuji (recommendations accepted, btw!), so I'm thinking of heading west after Tokyo to get into Central Honshu. From there I don't really know, but I imagine making my way through Kyoto &amp; Hiroshima. But the point of all this is should I have all my places booked ahead of time? It's so hard to choose where exactly I want to be on which days.

Ok I don't want this post to get too long so I'll end it here. Thanks for any help! So happy this subreddit exists, I've been reading your posts and y'all are awesome!"

JapanTravel,Traveling to Japan with small amount of Psychotropics (Xanax &amp; Ritalin),"I'm planning to bring a very small amount of Xanax (2mg) and a 10 day supply of ritalin (420mg) with me, both prescribed by my doctor.

The Narcotics dept website says both are well under the amount I'd need to declare and I plan on bringing them in their prescription bottles so I don't need any forms or certificates but I was curious if anyone had experiences with customs giving them a hard time anyway? 

I had customs give me a hard time in Australia over a non-controlled medication (that was fully legal in Aus, not a narcotic) so I'm always cautious when I travel."

JapanTravel,Type 1 diabetic trying to fill out Yunyu Kakunin-sho properly,"Hi all! 

So I’m a 22F traveling to Japan for about 2 and a half months from mid July to late September. I’m trying my best to get all my ducks in a row beforehand. 

I am a type 1 diabetic, and as such I have many medical supplies that I will be bringing with me. Some of the supplies I use on a daily basis and some I only use in case of emergency or one of my medical devices fails. 

I’m aware that because I will be bringing more than a months worth of supplies, I need to fill out the Yunyu Kakunin-sho. However, I’m having trouble finding out the extent to how much I have to fill this form out. As I said before, some supplies I don’t use on a daily basis and therefore don’t have an updated prescription for. These emergency supplies are legal in Japan and will be up to a month supply, but they are classified as medical devices, which is why I think they need to be filled out on the form. 

Most information I’ve been able to find are people who have either a) gotten their supplies in Japan or B) didn’t fill out the form because they brought less than a month prescription. I’m wondering if anyone has ever been in my situation and could give an example or their experience of what they filled out on this form. Below I’ve included the supplies I’m bringing and the amounts and I’m wondering if the supplies I’m unsure of need to be included on the Yunyu Kakunin-sho form. Any experience or advice regarding this would be extremely helpful. Thank you! 

Supplies I’m bringing: 

Things I know for sure that need to be on the Yunyu Kakunin-sho form: 

Insulin bottles (4 month supply) 
Pump sites (4 month supply) 
Dexcom sensors (4 month supply) 
Dexcom batteries (2 batteries (6 months supply))
Long lasting and short lasting insulin pens (1.5 month supply)


Things I’m unsure that need to be on the Yunyu Kakunin-sho: 

Insulin pump pdm (the device that communicates with the pump sites) (1 supply)
Syringes (1 month emergency supply)
Backup glucose Meter 
Strips and lancets for backup meter
Keytone strips 
Emergency glucagon (2 injectable kits)"
JapanTravel,"Trip Report 10 days Tokyo, Hakone, Kyoto, Osaka"," 

Just back from our honeymoon mid Feb to Japan and wanted to share our experience and recommendations. Don't mind the syntax...this was written 3am whilst jetlagged.

\*2 travelers early 30s, second time for me, first time for wife.

\*\*contrary to many redditors I did not exchange physical Yen ahead of time. Ordered a Wise debit card and had been converting Yen into account prior to trip as exchange rate fluctuated. Spot exchange was same if not better when we went so outside of a few 7-11 atm withdrawals with my Wise card, we swiped with our CC with no issues. Only places we needed to use cash were street vendors in and about Japan, and a select few cash only restaurants.

\*\*\*added Suica to Apple wallet, and loaded with my Wise Mastercard. I know some travelers had issues adding funds with visa etc-no issues with MC. Super convenient and topped up whenever we needed.

\*\*\*\*ordered Skyliner Express from Narita Airport to Tokyo, RomanceCar tix from Tokyo to Hakone, and Shinkansen from Hakone to Kyoto all online ahead of time or via mobile App.

\*\*\*\*\*I also bought the unlimited 3 day and subsequently another 2 day Tokyo metro pass from Klook. Highly recommend as breakeven per day is less than 4 metro swipe (each metro ride \~200yen). To pick up physical pass just need to swipe the QR code from purchase into a ticket kiosk that accepts qR (most do).

\*\*\*\*\*\*google maps still efficient in transportation and train routes

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*basement floors of any department store are a food lover’s paradise. Unlimited selections of bento/ebiken, and Japanese sweets/confectioneries. These made for great gifts.

Food Highlights: Sushi Shin, Chukasoba Biriken, Pizza Studio Tamaki, Akihabara Kenya Musashi Bujin, Mai-sen Tonkatsu, Misaki Standing Sushi. 

Day 1: Land Narita, Skyliner to Tokyo and metro to our Airbnb near Shinjuku. Picked up konbini for dinner and exchanged some Yen at 7-11.

Day 2: activated our 3 day unlimited metro (a few metro lines are not covered under the unlimited Tokyo metro; tapped Suica for those), and headed to Tsukiji Outer Market. Quieter than my first experience but still “lively” around 8am. Wife had her first of 14 bowls of noodles here. We had a few other misc street foods before walking towards Ginza. Explored Isetan then meandered over to Udon Shin. Good but not worth the 1.5 hour wait (when we finished the wait was &gt;4 hours). I recommend having a few “must hits” but we found impromptu google “best \_\_\_ near me” most suitable. No need to wait 1-2 hours for hype spots imo. After, we explored Shimokitazawa (hip neighborhood with coffee spots and vintage clothing, stickers) before our dinner rsvp at Sushi Shin in Asagawa. 18 courses and a great experience-lucked out bc we had great camaraderie with the Chef Shin and the other 4 patrons (6 seater).

Day 3: Early breakfast at a syokudo place called Shinpachi Shokudo in Shinjuku. Traditional set course containing a fish, miso soup, pickles, and seaweed salad. Senso-Ji, Nakamise Street, Suzuzien Matcha (renovations in their original location so new one is around the corner). “Proclaimed strongest matcha ice-cream, highly rec. Stumbled into this local duck ramen at Homemade Noodle Billiken in Asakusa-hands down best ramen of our trip. Light flavorful broth and perfectly cooked duck breasts. The unlimited vinegar was the perfect pairing to offset the oils from the duck. From there we walked to Shibuya (Mega Don Quijote), before heading back to airbnb for some r&amp;r before dinner. 830 dinner at Hakkoku. Experience &gt; flavor. I mean, 29 courses with 25 of them being nigiri…bound to be a few meh novel fish types. Highlights include-tossaki chu-toro hand roll, monkfish liver, warm roe, fugu (no distinct flavor but at least we can say we tried), and the honeymoon tamago they made for us. Ended meal at 11:30pm.

Day 4: no set plans so lined up for Ichiran (same flavor as NYC but 25% of the price), explored a few malls i.e basement foods, Tokyo Station, Sembikiya, Kinokuniya etc. Went to Takano fruit parlor for their whole honeydew dessert+ mango parfait. Are Japanese fruits expensive? Yes…but I’d rather pay for them than the “Oishi strawberries we have at Whole Foods for $20”. Dinner in Roppongi at Pizza Studio Tamaki. Japanese Neapolitan pizzas that give the NY pies a run for their money. Walked around Kabukicho in the evening; we enjoyed seeing all the host clubs and egged each other into going into one. Didn’t happen; instead, I heard the sound of batting cages and pulled the wife in. We both loved it. Highly recommend as a 1hr break as these aren’t too common in the States. Hitting bombs against 90km fastballs.

Day 5/6: Food and local neighborhood exploring day; Shrimp tsukemen at Gonokami, Mai-Sen tonkatsu, standing sushi and soba inside Shinjuku station. Dropped off our 2 large suitcases with Yamato Ta-Q-Bin at the info center inside the station as we didn’t want to lug them around to overnight trips to Hakone and Kyoto later. Seamless process \~$20 usd for a medium side roller. We discovered Public Tokyo and United Tokyo this day and boy…did we spend. Minimalistic, contemporary made in Japan clothing. 100% recommend. 

Day 7: RomanceCar to Hakone. I booked the first car for the views and an opportunity to spy on the train conductor. Picked up sashimi bento at Shinjuku station malls before hopping on board. Great views of Mt. Fuji along the way. Spent a few hours walking near the Hakone Yamato Station and slurping soba before taking the bus to our private onsen at Senkyoro. Would recommend in a heartbeat. The private onsen was lovely as well as the dinner and breakfast kaiseki. The ryokan gifted us a framed portrait, courtesy of our host. Great way to be unplugged and relax after 10+ miles of daily walking.

Day 8: Bullet train to Kyoto. We enjoyed the quieter streets to Higashiyama (Sanneizaka/Nineizaka) as those streets were inundated with foreign tourists, something we didn’t really see in Tokyo fortunately! Wagyu roast beef bowls for lunch and some pottery shopping. Gion Duck noodles for dinner-be warned, coming for dinner may require waiting in a dark, claustrophobic alley. Small intimate restaurant with a more avant gaude approach to duck ramen compared to previous spot in Tokyo. 

Day 9: Obligatory Fushimi Inari visit; maybe better without the tourists. All in all Kyoto not our favorite city, but we didn’t spend enough time to give a proper review. Trained to Osaka for our final Japan leg. Checked in early to W Osaka before exploring the city and its malls. Dotonburi in the evening. 

Day 10: More food and shopping. Great izakaya spot inside the Parco mall. $3 grilled fish collarbones, negi-toro handrolls, hotate nigiri = heaven."

JapanTravel,How to make friends with local in Tokyo?(real life approach only),"I’m in Tokyo currently and if possible in the future I’d like to move here but for now doing tourism and identifying places that are good/not good to move in.
But my issue is that well I’d like to make some friends with locals here during my trip here but I don’t know what to do.
I speak Japanese, language isn’t a barrier I though this will help me but but yet don’t know what to do cause well first I’m an introvert and I don’t know what to say and where exactly to meet people.
I tried to look at meetup but it’s mainly foreigners together while I want to befriend local people and I want to avoid Gaikokujin hunters who only are interested to you only cause you are a foreigner and I prefer a real life approach than on my phone, i don’t mind people wishing to befriend me to practice French or English but I don’t want it to be the sole reason they like me.
I considered going to Kabukicho cause I heard it’s very friendly but night club isn’t my type of crowd and i worry about the type of person I can meet here cause it’s a red light distract (or perhaps I should re considers as long I’m careful since I have no intentions to go there for lewd things?)

I tried yesterday to speak to someone in Akihabara by complimenting her shoes (they were super pretty)but the exchange was awkward « excuse me, I just wanted say you have pretty shoes » « Hmm…thank you» « Have a good day » REALLY awkward.
it’s already a big effort for me but didn’t worked well and I still feel this awkwardness.
Learned from my extrovert friend it’s probably best to talk to people who are alone or in a group the one that is detached and to avoid two people together.

Please give me tips I really want to make friends on Tokyo but I don’t know what to do!"

JapanTravel,Rate my Itinerary + Gion Matsuri Questions,"Hi all, looking for some feedback on my below itinerary and also some insight from anyone who has attended Gion Matsuri in the past. Traveling to Japan for the first time with my partner this July (I know it’s intensely hot &amp; humid but we’re going for a wedding so this is the time we have to go). Will gladly take any advice on how to stay cool. 


Below is our tentative itinerary:


Day 1/Sat: Arrive at Haneda Airport around 1pm. Travel to hotel, settle in, have dinner


Day 2/Sun: Tokyo: Explore Shibuya/Shinjuku areas (Meiji Jingu, Takeshita Street, etc.)


Day 3/Mon: Take the train to Tokyo DisneySea for the day


Day 4/Tues: Tokyo: Akihabra Day (arcades, shopping, etc.)


Day 5/Weds: Looking at potentially booking a day trip to Mt. Fuji through Viator


Day 6/Thurs: Tokyo: Undecided but maybe teamLab Planets or Ghibli Museum/Shrio-Hige’s Cream Puff factory (I read that the Ghibli Museum is not worth it for English speakers. If anyone has been let me know your thoughts)


Days 7 &amp; 8/Fri &amp; Sat: Wedding in Mito


Day 9/Sun: This is where it gets tricky. We will be with the wedding party still during the day. Option 1 is take a late afternoon train to Tokyo then an evening train down to Kyoto to arrive late at night but be able to experience the Gion Matsuri Festival Parade at 9am the next morning. Option 2 is to stay this night in Tokyo and then travel to Kyoto the next morning to arrive in the afternoon. Will miss the parade but will be way less rushed. Will the trains be packed this day with the festival?


Day 10/Mon: Kyoto: either wake up and see Gion Matsuri parade if we traveled the previous night OR arrive in Kyoto this afternoon. Plan for the afternoon was to see Fushimi Inari Shrine and go to Maccha House. Is this possible the afternoon of a festival day or will the entire city be shut down/jam packed?


Day 11/Tues: Kyoto: Arashiyama Monkey Park, Bamboo Forest, Tea House. Will this again all be insanely crowded the day after a festival?


Day 12/Weds: Kyoto: Morning doing anything we didn’t fit in the last two days. Afternoon travel back to Tokyo


Days 13-14/Thurs &amp; Fri: Tokyo: undecided, anything we didn’t get to; maybe Toshima/Taito City areas. Maybe stay in Kyoto one more night and do a daytrip to Hiroshima or Nara.


Day 15: Travel home


If anyone has any insight especially on the days in Kyoto/time around Gion Matsuri please let me know. 


I am also looking for recommendations for hotels along the Yamanote line in Tokyo and Ryokan in Kyoto. For travel days after we check out of hotels is it possible to leave large luggage in coin lockers?


Thank you!"

How time flies where 3 years ago I asked about my Tokyo trip here in this forum that was meant for my girlfriend, this time she is travelling with me as my fiancé now.

Alright my trip will be 12 days long (not counting 18/4 as I'll be leaving early in the morning). Our main areas are Osaka, Koyasan, Kyoto, and a day trip to Nara, pretty standard itinerary. We like our trip to be lax and not too rush, but of course we are open to more suggestions, especially we are visiting during the Cherry Blossom season.

Both of us would like this trip to be more cultural themed, and it would be great if there are suggestions of places that are off-beaten and not too touristy (Although the list below will be quite touristy lol). We are not big eaters or shopaholics as well, but we are open to suggestions on exploring local food spots and interesting stores/malls.

Any suggestions on any 2 day hikes that may be more appropriate through Spring? Particularly ones with views and not on roads. Doesn't necessarily have to be near Kamigotchi but preferably in a scenic region worth spending a few days exploring. Thanks team"

I’m heading to Japan next week and am getting a bit confused online so was looking for any advice. 

I have a trip to Nikko planned for 4 days and am trying to work out if the Nikko All Area Pass will be worth it for my trip. I plan to explore the shrines and temples, and catch the bus to Lake Chuzenji, take the cable car, visit Yumoto Onsen and explore Tobu World Square etc. 

The catch is, that I will be making my way to Nikko from Nozawaonsen, so won’t use 1x train journey from Asakusa station, however I will be leaving Nikko and travelling to Asakusa station, so I will use that return train trip. 

Does anyone have any advice about whether the Nikko All Area Pass is still worth it, or whether it would be worth paying for my train from Nikko to Asakusa and then getting some sort of buss pass around Nikko? 
Thanks in advance!"

My wife and I are travelling on early August (4th to 18th). We are both 39 and we are not too ""crazy"" we like calm things, so we avoid most nightlife.

I tried to do my list by checking in Google Maps how far or near was each place between them to try to make the best use of time, but I might have mixed up some places.

We wanted to attend Awa Odori but couldn't find any lodging anymore on Tokushima but I'm considering maybe doing a visit from Kyoto on the 14th. We are also considering staying in Kyoto until the 16th to watch Daimonji. (Here I already have lodging) 

I saw that the JR pass is cheaper If I buy it locally at a travel agent, however it seems I cannot make online reservations with this version of the pass, would this be a hindrance for me? Should I just not risk it?

JapanTravel,Itinerary Check Hokkaido 6 Days,"Hello everyone.
we'll be start my first leg of my 2 weeks Japan trip from Hokkaido
with 2 big luggages with us
Starting From 26 April - 1/2 May
i just wondering is it too rushing or we do too many city within 6 Days?
and is it feasible to this itinerary.
So this would be my rundown

Day 1 
26 April : Arrival at Sapporo at 6PM
i'll be spending 1 Nights here 
Staying at Sapporo Station
maybe going to susukino to look around for a moment.

Day 2 
27 April
My next stop would be Asahikawa
i'm planning to stay 2 Nights in asahikawa
First day to spend my time to Asahiyama Zoo &amp; city tour.

Day 3 
28 April
I think maybe going to biei to go to Shikisai No Oka. i tried do my research on google and found out that the tulip starting to bloom, is it true ?
and maybe if i had a time, i'll go to blue pond also. 
and later i'll be back to asahikawa.

Day 4 
29 April
Back to Sapporo
City tour and going to Otaru / Mt Miowa Observatory at the afternoon

Day 5
30 April
I'm planning to spend a night trying to experience Onsen at Noboribetsu
i do my research and found out that Noboribetsu Grand Hotel Offer Private Onsen, so maybe i'll spend a night at that hotel. or do you have other suggestion which hotel / maybe ryokan that offer private onsen ?

Day 6 
Hakodate
maybe a little city tour and to enjoy the Cherry blossom if we lucky enough 🤞🏻.

And tomorrow i'll take shinkansen to continue our 2nd leg trip.

and all my trip would be covered by public transport since my indonesia international driving license not recognized by japanese government.

any input would be much appreciated.
thank you"

JapanTravel,Thoughts on a short trip to Kyoto/ Osaka,"This is probably not the most financially efficient  but I need a vacation and I've been pining to get back to Japan. For background I've been to Tokyo for about a week 10 years ago. 

My options are the 6th-12th, yes tomorrow. Or the 21st-27th. Later in the month would give me an extra day and a little more time to plan but I know cherry blossom season is coming. I'd also miss out on the sumo tournament if I leave tomorrow. 

I typically plan loosely and then play things by ear so I have a few things I know want to see. I also really want to try the food and bars in osaka and to a lesser extent kyoto. I was planning on staying in kyoto and taking the train back and forth. However would osaka be a better place to stay instead with day trips to kyoto?

I plan to land in Tokyo and take the bullet train over for the experience as well. Thanks."
JapanTravel,Two Week July Itinerary Questions,"Hi all, looking for some feedback/advice on my below itinerary. Traveling to Japan for the first time with my partner this July (I know it’s intensely hot &amp; humid but we’re going for a wedding so this is the time we have to go). Will gladly take any advice on how to stay cool. 

Below is our tentative itinerary:

Day 1/Sat: Arrive at Haneda Airport around 1pm. Travel to hotel, settle in, have dinner

Day 2/Sun: Tokyo: Explore Shibuya/Shinjuku areas (Meiji Jingu, Takeshita Street, etc.)

Day 3/Mon: Take the train to Tokyo DisneySea for the day

Day 4/Tues: Tokyo: Akihabra Day (arcades, shopping, etc.)

Day 5/Weds: Looking at potentially booking a day trip to Mt. Fuji through Viator

Day 6/Thurs: Tokyo: Undecided but maybe teamLab Planets or Ghibli Museum/Shrio-Hige’s Cream Puff factory (I read that the Ghibli Museum is not worth it for English speakers. If anyone has been let me know your thoughts)

Days 7 &amp; 8/Fri &amp; Sat: Wedding in Mito

Day 9/Sun: This is where it gets tricky. We will be with the wedding party still during the day. Option 1 is take a late afternoon train to Tokyo then an evening train down to Kyoto to arrive late at night but be able to experience the Gion Matsuri Festival Parade at 9am the next morning. Option 2 is to stay this night in Tokyo and then travel to Kyoto the next morning to arrive in the afternoon. Will miss the parade but will be way less rushed. Will the trains be packed this day with the festival?

Day 10/Mon: Kyoto: either wake up and see Gion Matsuri parade if we traveled the previous night OR arrive in Kyoto this afternoon. Plan for the afternoon was to see Fushimi Inari Shrine and go to Maccha House. Is this possible the afternoon of a festival day or will the entire city be shut down/jam packed?

Day 11/Tues: Kyoto: Arashiyama Monkey Park, Bamboo Forest, Tea House. Will this again all be insanely crowded the day after a festival?

Day 12/Weds: Kyoto: Morning doing anything we didn’t fit in the last two days. Afternoon travel back to Tokyo

Days 13-14/Thurs &amp; Fri: Tokyo: undecided, anything we didn’t get to; maybe Toshima/Taito City areas. Maybe stay in Kyoto one more night and do a daytrip to Hiroshima or Nara.

Day 15: Travel home

If anyone has any insight especially on the days in Kyoto/time around Gion Matsuri please let me know. 

I am also looking for recommendations for hotels along the Yamanote line in Tokyo and Ryokan in Kyoto. For travel days after we check out of hotels is it possible to leave large luggage in coin lockers?

Thank you!"

JapanTravel,Unexpectedly terrible GAC pocket router experience,"Hi all,
I used Reddit and this particular subreddit to gather intel on WiFi routers and ended up selecting Global Advanced Communications: they had great reviews from other travelers and good price. I wanted to share my ongoing experience with them as it may help someone make decisions in similar situations. Here goes the saga.

TL;DR: shipped one router, didn't work. Shipped another one, didn't work differently. I hacked the working router from battery and SIM card of both: worked, but GAC got mad. I got pissed; to be continued.

INTRO: PICKING UP AND DIAGNOSING THE ROUTER 

My trip to Japan is a multi-city, 3-week itinerary, so I opted for a WiFi router; I went with my partner so I wanted her to be able to use the internet too.

I have made an order online which was convenient and received the confirmation thereafter. I chose to pick up the device in Narita airport where I was supposed to land. When the time approached, they've sent me a shipping confirmation saying that my router has been dispatched to Narita and specifying the pickup spot. They dispatched it timely, and the pick up spot's Google Maps listing said they'd be open after the time I land. All this made me feel confident.

The pick up was smooth, and I decided to open the box with the device right away to get online and figure my logistics. The box contained the device, the charger, and an envelope to send the device back, which is also convenient.
When trying the router I noticed it had low charge, and after 10-20 minutes of usage the router died and wouldn't turn back on, as well it didn't react to charging attempts from my power bank and any outlets. By testing the GAC charger with my phone I understood that the router itself was at fault: probably someone just plugged it in and threw into the box to ship without testing.

PART I. REPLACEMENT ONE

I wrote an email to GAC; it was Sunday so they came back to me on Monday and sent the replacement that arrived in two days. They also refunded me a couple of days of service.

I was lucky that my Airbnb host had a WiFi router to she has kindly allowed to take out (thank you Airin!!!) so meanwhile I was able to use internet with a functioning router, NOT by GAC.

As I stayed in Airbnb, GAC couldn't ship the replacement right to the apartment - I had to go and pick it up in a post office. I was not too excited about it, cause it would take time from my holiday, but I was curious to check the local post office out. The pick up was smooth and post office folks were very helpful and respectful.
Identically to the previous delivery, I decided to open it up right away.

PART II. REPLACEMENT TWO

As you probably guessed from the length of this post, dear reader, the replacement router also didn't work.

Unlike the previous one, it held the charge OK, but it wouldn't connect to the internet at all.
Luckily, I still had my host's router, but the checkout time was approaching as I had to leave to Kyoto. It was weekend when I was taking the trip, and communication with GAC continued after I arrived to Kyoto. GAC doesn't offer support over the weekend, which is understandable, but I was super annoyed by the perspective of not having connection and translation in a foreign and complex country such as Japan. (Spoiled by tech, I know, but I also like my stuff according to plan).

PART III. HACKING ROUTERS TOGETHER

GAC recommended me various procedures of resetting the 2nd router, including taking the battery and the SIM out. I've done all that, still no connection. I was beginning to get impatient cause all that was eating away the time from my holiday and making the trip less convenient due to having to connect to public WiFi spots to check the map. Annoying! I asked GAC if the SIM was active, and they've confirmed it was. That was the end of our joint investigation that led to only one possible outcome: replacement number three T_T

But wait... Taking the battery out? I already forgot that some mobile devices used to have replaceable batteries.

This gave me an idea of taking the working SIM from the first router and the battery from the second, placing it into the first router which had earlier successfully connected to the internet. Effectively I was compiling working components of GAC's broken tech into one piece that would hopefully work... 

And voila! It work ed.
I was happy as this headache-provoking crap has ended. I notified GAC to assure they don't need to send me a third replacement and headed out to see Kyoto's Gion at sunset. I said I'd let them know how it will perform further.

PART IV. ANGRY GAC (and angry me)

I ignored my email for that evening but enjoyed good connectivity from GAC for the first time, 7 days after I was supposed 5o get it. i checked my inbox back at my stay to find out that GAC was incredibly upset with me swapping SIMs in the routers. They've asked me to NOT SWITCH THE SIM CARD (in caps) and repeated it few times, which made me believe it was a big deal. They didn't explain why, but they insisted that I was renting the items, so I am not allowed to switch the SIM cards

Also they've suggested to send me a new router (for the third f***ing time), which would arrive on 8th of march (9 days after my initial pick up).

That was the tipping point for me. Not only they were unable to provide a functioning device in 2 attempts (test before you ship, yo) but also they didn't explain the reasons. (I assume pure bureaucracy, but happy to comply.)

PART V. STATUS FOR TODAY
I think it's pretty fair to say that they have failed to provide their core advertised service to me, after 2 attempts. They've also lost any credibility, and I have no reason to believe their 3rd device won't be a waste of time (what are the chances, huh). 

I've proposed that they refund me full period of rental and I ship the devices back to them, or they let me keep devices in current configuration that works, and I make sure that correct SIM card is placed in respective broken router upon return. 
Will post here what they'd reply :)"

JapanTravel,Short 5 day (greater) Tokyo Itinerary - Need advice!,"I've been lurking around this sub for a while but have never posted before because my itinerary had yet to be drafted up. As i draw closer to my departure date i think it's finally time to ask what yall think of it

Day 1:
- Arriving in afternoon, will probably crash at hotel for the day. Might explore local area if not jet lagged.

- Evening meal at hotel (or a chain resturant)

Day 2:

- Make a B-line for akihabara for the morning

- i've heard good things about a certain gyudon chain, lunch solved (Locations in both akiba &amp; yokohama)

- roughly before or after lunch, head down to yokohama

(Note, might swap morning &amp; afternoon again, originally was reverse)

- Some local ramen/noodle place for evening meal

Day 3: (The one i care about)

- I do hiking, and Mount Tsukuba is on my bucket list. Early morning pick up stuff to eat for breakfast &amp; on the summit, which i'd expect to be there at lunch.

- on way back (roughly 4-6PM), get off at asakusa &amp; spend whole evening there (just winging it)

Day 4: (The yamanote lightning round)

- Much later start thanks to yesterday, prolly out after 10AM

- As title suggests, yamanote line covers the whole day (Shinjuku &amp; Shibuya focus, plus surrounding neighborhoods) unsure about the details on this day

Day 5: (What)

- i have no more ideas, need more

Day 6 is the flight back, but it's early morning so i'm not counting it.

I know it's not the best of itinerary drafts, i'm not great at these kinda things. Looking forward to what yall have to say!"

JapanTravel,Pros and cons of eSim vs pocketwifi in Japan both in big cities and more rural areas for 1 month,"Hi all, as the title suggests I will be traveling to Japan next month for about a month, going to a mix of big cities like Tokyo, Kyoto, to some more rural areas like Fujiyoshida and wanted to see if people had experiences with the subject to share as I feel there isn't too much discussion on this topic.

The reason I am debating between eSim and portable wifi is mostly for cost efficiency and decluttering.

My research shows that Ubigi is widely considered one of the best eSims for Japan and will cost me above $17 for 10gb data. I can set it up at home and have it work when I arrive which is nice. And the best part is I do not need to worry about carrying a extra device and charging it as well. 

Conventionally though, it seems pocket wifis are still the more widely used product. Above $120 for the time I will be there, and my friend that recently went complained she had to constantly charge it, as well as her phone which makes things a big more of a hassle. To me, it seems the no brainer is going with the esim but I wonder if its too good to be true? 

In more rural areas will pocket wifi actually be more consistent than an eSim? My big fear is my eSim wifi service dropping in and out or having poor connection which would lead to annoyance. But I figured if I did the eSim and hated it, I could always rent a pocket wifi then can't I? 

&amp;#x200B;

P.S. if it makes a difference I have a unlocked iPhone 12 pro on T-Mobile network. Thank you all for your insights and I hope this could help others as well who are in a similar situation."

JapanTravel,Suggestions for day trip from Kanazawa,"Hi everyone,

I'm going to Kanazawa tomorrow (Tuesday 7th) and will return to Tokyo on Friday (10th).

I want to spend Tuesday and Wednesday in Kanazawa and wouuld ideally do some kind of day trip in the area, possibly with a one night stay, over Thursday and Friday.

I've been to Takayama and Shirakawa-go before. Noto peninsula looks amazing but I won't be renting a car. I can see that trains go as far as Nanao and Wakura onsen, and a local train goes to Anamizu, but I'm not sure if there's much to do there. There's also Toyama on the way back to Tokyo but again not sure if there would be a great deal to see.

I'd be grateful for any suggestions of other places to go near Kanazawa, thanks!"

JapanTravel,Need some help choosing where to go.,"So I'll start by saying I'm not interested in the flashy consumerism of Tokyo. Nor do I have interest in anime/manga culture.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a lot of interest in Taoism in Japan, and to a lesser extent Zen Buddhism. I have researched and admire the likes of Matsuo Basho and Utagawa Hiroshige. Simple life as poetry type stuff. Essentially, I'm looking for the slower, natural Japan. 

&amp;#x200B;

This trip will not be for another couple of years due to finances. In that time I will be taking Japanese classes at my University, and will be trying my hardest to have adequate conversational skills, as I save up for this trip with my partner. 

&amp;#x200B;

As a start, I live in Portland, and our sister city in Japan is Sapporo. Hot springs and hot sake sounds nice. I also have seen that Basho is buried at a shrine in Shiga. I also wonder about paying my respects at the two big bombsites eventually.

&amp;#x200B;

I have a lot of interest in arts and culture, I want to talk to locals, relax, and soak in Japan as not just a list of places to spend money and be around a bunch of other tourists. My partner is allergic to dairy and doesn't eat meat, so if there are any places a little more vegetarian friendly that would be good to know. Also places easily accessible by public transit would be better than having to rent a car.

&amp;#x200B;

Any ideas so I can start planning/knowing how much to save would be appreciated. Mostly I just want to be away from wealthy white folk tourists."

JapanTravel,Safely getting around Tokyo,"(Not sure if necessary, but putting the 18+ tag because of the nature of the topic)

Hey everyone!

Just saying it right at the beginning, I have an anxiety disorder and with that comes all kind of trouble.

I'm in Tokyo at the moment, until Saturday. I'm traveling with my girlfriend and an older lady who we are friends with.

Today our friend suggested that we go see the Tokyo Skytree and we would go there by taking the subway. Of course we could also take a taxi, but going around by taxi all the time seems a bit unnecessary and a bit expensive to me.

I know that Japan is one of the safest countries in terms of crime and we don't plan on going to any bad areas to my knowledge. We're staying in Shibuya near Shibuya Station and like I mentioned, we want to go see the Skytree. Then tomorrow we'll maybe go check out Akihibara. On Wednesday we're going to the Pokémon Café and the Pokémon Center DX.

I just wonder...Is it really safe to use public transport in Tokyo? Especially considering my female friends. You know, with all the sexual harassment and groping/chikan stuff you hear in the media and shit. Maybe I'm paranoid because of my anxiety disorder, but I don't want anything to happen to my girlfriend or our older lady friend. And of course I'm not keen on getting into verbal altercations, much less into physical ones. (Which doesn't mean I wouldn't yell at someone if I had to. Hell yeah, I would go verbally beserk.) I'm not a person who wants to get into trouble.

I know there are women-only train cars, but as far as I know only during rush hours in Tokyo? And also we don't really want to seperate our trio, as I would then have to go alone into a normal ""mixed"" train car, since, well, as a guy I obviously can't be in a women-only one.

Should we just take public transport, try to stay out of the rush hours and stand together in a spot away from the doors? Or should we take the money into our hands and just take a taxi?

Thanks for your advice and sorry if I seem stupid, weird or paranoid. Usually I'm quite ok with my anxiety stuff and I haven't felt anxious so far in Tokyo except for once when we were walking home in the dark, but there wasn't a reason for that. Everything went fine."

# Questions: 

1. Are we missing anything major? Are we doing too much on the days we have planned? We could use some help on the free days :) 
2. When's the best time frame to reserve at a restaurant? (Couple weeks, days, hours in advance). I understand reserving at popular spots should be done well in advance but for other restaurants did you find it okay reserving day of (Or not reserving at all)? 
3. I've been reading that Credit Cards are being accepted in more places but cash is still widely used. For a 3 week trip how much would you recommend starting off with in Cash? I was going to start off with $1000 - $1500 CAD (About 100 000 - 150 000 Yen) and then withdraw from ATMs as needed but don't want to start off with too little / too much cash. (Budget around $100 - $150 CAD (About 10 000 - 15 000 Yen) a day would be my best guess). 

Thanks again for your help!"

JapanTravel,Six Days in Kyushu itinerary!,"Hello all!

Planning to do a roadtrip around Kyushu in late April. The itinerary is inspired by  trip reports from other redditors (Thank you to them!) and advice posted by other users on here. I would love to get everyone else's comments and ideas, thank you! 

**Day 1 - Thursday - Fukuoka** 

Arrive from Seoul at Fukuoka airport at 1:20pm. Planning to check-in to hotel before exploring city like the Ramen Stadium, Kirby cafe (if we can get a booking) and Kushida Shrine. Plan for night time is to check out yatais before an earlier night to get ready for our road trip.

**Day 2 - Friday - Fukuoka to Nagasaki via Karatsu or Yanagawa**

Pick-up car at 8am from car rental. Today's goal is to Nagasaki and I am in two minds on which way to go. 

Option 1: Go west! Leave Fukuoka and go check out Sakurai Futamigaura's Couple Stones, Karatsu Castle before heading south via Imari and the Saga prefecture for pottery. Then we will keep driving south to Nagasaki, hopefully get there just before sunset, check-in and go up  Mt Inasa. Check-out the nightlife at Nagasaki before retiring for the night.

Option 2: Go south! Leave Fukuoka and go visit Nanzoin Temple and and Dazaifu Tenmangu Shrine. Then we keep heading south to grab lunch and check out Yanagawa. From there drive to Nagasaki and follow afternoon/evening plan for Option 1. 

For Option 1, we have been to Himeji and Osaka castles so not sure if we should still check-out Karatsu Castle. As for Option 2, are there any other towns, cities or areas from Yanagawa to Nagasaki that we can check-out pottery? 

**Day 3 - Saturday - Nagasaki to Kumamoto via Shimabara**

Morning activities include visiting Nagasaki Peace Park (we have been to Hiroshima in a previous trip), Chinatown and Dejima before heading leaving the city and drive towards Mt Unzen and check out the national park. Would love to fit in a hike there. From Mt Unzen we will drive to Shimabara and jump on a barge to Kumamoto.  We hope to get to Kumamoto in the afternoon and check out some of the sights there before retiring for the night.

**Day 4 - Sunday - Kumamoto to Aso township**

Check out Kumamoto castle then leave for Aso township. Plan is to visit the Aso area and visit places such as Shiiba village, Takachiho gorge (I am aware the landslides, will also have lunch there), Kamishikimi Kumanoimasu Shrine and Mt Aso crater no.1 (if opens). We will then retire for the night at a ryokan in Aso. 

**Day 5 - Monday - Aso township to Beppu**

From Aso we will go up to Daikanbo Lookout, Minamooguni and Kurokawa Onsen. Then from there we will check out Yufuin before heading to Beppu for another ryokan there. 

**Day 6 - Tuesday - Beppu to Fukuoka**

Check out Beppu (Seven Hells etc) before heading back to Fukuoka to return car by 2pm. Plan is to drive along the Expressway for a quicker return trip. Depending on time and whether we went with Options 1 or 2, will go check out Sakurai Futamigaura's Couple Stones or Nanzoin Temple and Dazaifu Tenmangu Shrine. Once we return the car we will catch the Shinkansen to Osaka for our next part of our trip! 

I guess my questions are:

1. Am I being too ambitious? I know there is a lot of driving involved. I come from Australia so I do not mind long distance driving. 
2. I understand that Expressway cost heaps of money in Japan but they definitely save travelling time (especially from Fukuoka to Nagasaki and Beppu to Fukuoka). I understand that the Kyushu Expressway Pass is currently not on sale, are there any other good alternatives? Either way I am happy to to pay for them. 
3. What are some food we must try? Or places I have missed and we should definitely go and check it out?  

Thank you everyone once again and much appreciate your time, comments and helpful hints and advice!"

My one regret was not taking more chances on just eating at more places and doing more things outside of the tour group since I was solo.

I want to visit again but I wonder how to plan my second trip. What are your experiences?"

JapanTravel,"Shibuya, Shinjuku, and Harajuku","We have 10 full days in Tokyo. We is my wife, college-aged daughter, and high-school aged son. Some districts, like say Ueno, should only fill a few hours for us, but it's the big districts like Shibuya and Shinjuku that I'm trying to gauge. Both have a lot to offer for all of us, and I see us spending a full 12 hours in each.

Harajuku is located halfway between both but only seems to require a few hours to me. Any opinions on how to tack on Harajuku to either Shibuya or Shinjuku? Alternatively, any suggestions on how to tour all three in two days? Maybe nearly full days in both Shibuya and Shinjuku with a tiny bit of Harajuku in both days?"
JapanTravel,Just came back from Japan last week and I want to share my itinerary/thoughts.,"As the title says, I recently returned from Japan and I had the time of my life. Everything from the food, culture, Japanese people's politeness and the craziness of central Tokyo...It was an absolute blast. Super keen on getting back out there again for longer. I'll definitely be more well prepared to make journey much smoother, which I'll go into more detail below. I spend 11 days in total in Japan which was spread across Tokyo, Osaka and Kyoto. I also travelled solo.

**Airport**

Regardless of what airport you fly into, you'll want to take the public trains into Tokyo. Taxi's are notooriously expensive in Japan and should only be used in emergencies. This is assuming you are on a budget, otherwise go crazy.

If you can, I highly advise you to fly into Haneda as it'll make your journey much shorter and easier to get to Tokyo. Narita is nowhere near Tokyo and you'll have to take a long train journey to Tokyo station most likely which is a pain to navigate even without being jetlagged. 

**On Arrival At Airport**

So there are a couple of things you want to do when you touch down. Buy a Sim Card and get a Pasmo/Suica card.

* So I tried to cut costs and buy a sim card once I got closer to my accomodation. Although it saved me money, it was a pain getting to my accomodation relying on free wifi and directions I prepared before my flight. I would say buy a sim card at the airport. Make sure your phone is unlocked.
* The other thing you'll want to do is get a pasmo/suica card. Not sure the difference between the two but the method is more or less the same. Load the card up with money and you can use that for travel, vending machines etc. Trust me it'll save so much time and hassle!
* The other thing I'll reccomend is taking out a lot of cash. If you're buying the Pasmo/Suica card I believe you'll have to have physical cash to load them up. I'll say take out around $200 worth for now. Although a lot of places in Tokyo accept card, the country is still a cash based society so you'll almost certainly come across establishments that only take cash. 

**Commuting**

Unless you are willing to blow a ton of money during your trip, you will be depending on public transport during your trip. In all three cities I visitied, I was using public transport several times a day. There is also the Shinkansen to get from Tokyo to the Kansai region (Osaka, Kyoto). It's great and an activity within itself.

**Other notes**

Yeah so Japan's culture is different from the west. So try your best to assimiliate, look up videos on Youtube on what to expect and do. Learn some Japanese as well. These aren't a must but you don't want to look like a\*\*hole. Sooner you start the better.

**Itinerary**

Day 1: Arrived in Tokyo and settled in. Stayed in Shinjuku. Walked around Shinjuku, avoided the scammers in Shinjuku (wasted some of their time by having pointless conversations). Had some ramen and hung out with fellow solo travellers in Golden Gai. 

Day 2: Checked out Tsukiji Market for some delicious fresh seafood. Ventured off to Akihabara to check out the nerd culture and play some games. Ended the night in Golden Gai before going to a batting cage. 

Day 3: Visited Asakusa for temples and shopping in the area. Went to Shibuya in the evening to check out the crossing and ate some sushi from a conveyer belt resturaunt. Had a nap before heading to Roppongi for a bar crawl. Ended up in Shibuya again for an Izakaya (specialised in chicken skin) and nightclub (Womb). 

Day 4: Woke up late from being exhausted from the previous night. Checked out Ikebukuro for sunshine city. Had Wagyu beef for dinner in Akihabara.

Day 5: Checked out Teamlab Planets (very cool). Wandered around Shinjuku some more (Don Quiote store is fun) before going to an anime themed bar in Nakano. Ended the night at an Izakaya in Shinjuku, Karaoke and nightclub (Warp). 

Day 6: Slept in for a bit before heading to the Shinkansen to Osaka. Got myself a bento box for the journey. On arrival in Osaka I checked into my hostel around Namba area and I had curry at a buffalo curry place (forgot the name). Explored Dottonbori for a bit and tried some street food. 

Day 7: Went to Universal Studios Japan. Such a fun experience but the food was poor. If you go buy the express pass as it will save time. Went back to Namba area after for some Shabu-shabu (hot pot) before going to a karaoke and club (Giraffe). 

Day 8: Took it easy and checked out Osaka castle. Had some more food in the Dottonbori area before going to a bar to chillout. Had an early night for the next day. 

Day 9: Day trip to Kyoto. That's right I only did a day trip. However, I managed to check out a lot of the main sights (Fushimi-Inari, Ginkaku-Ji, Gion, Arashiyama). It was very crowded so had to depend on a taxi to get to Kyoto station. Ended the day with some drinks at a bar and went to Giraffe club again.

Day 10: Train back to Tokyo. Grabbed another bento box. Stayed in the Roppongi area which is a rather bougie area. Relaxed at an Onsen (public bathhouse) which was uncomfortable until you get in the bath. Highly reccomend. Had some Sushi before heading to bed.

Day 11: Last day in Japan. My flight wasn't until late night so spent the day checking out Ueno and doing some shopping (lot's of snacks). Ate as much food as possible before getting the Narita express to the airport.

&amp;#x200B;

So there you have it. I feel like I did a decent amount whilst leaving enough time to just explore and not feel pressured to stick to a plan. Honestly, there is a ton of stuff to do in Japan and some of my favourite nights were when I just had an open mind. My favourite areas in Tokyo were Tsukiji Market, Shinjuku and Shibuya. I reccomend staying in the Shinjuku area if you are into nightlife and good food. Otherwise, check out Asakusa which is more chill but has tons to do. For Osaka, I would say stay in the Namba area if you are into nightlife. 

Overall, Japan was a blast with so many cool things such as vending machines (which actually work), their obsession with Gatcha toys and the variety of foods they have on offer. I definitely want to check out this amazing country again."

JapanTravel,Trip in October / November - Kyushu or Tohoku?,"Hi,

I am planing my second Japan trip. The first one was End October to November 2019. At the moment I am totally overwhelmed about the possibilities I have. I am not the guy who plans every day until the last detail, but I want to have a plan.

**When**

I will be in Japan from October, 17th to November, 11th. Flight is already booked. Starting and ending from Tokyo NRT.

**What have I seen on my first trip?**

Tokyo, Kyoto, Oska, Hiroshima 

with daytrips to: Nara, Miyajima, Himeji, Nikko 

**Budget**

I will buy the Rail Pass to be flexible in travel. Hotel prices should be not too expensive, but I am not looking to save the money. 

**Context**

I am 36 and love to explore cities and areas. I am more the ""explorer"" and love to take incredible photos. Not really into relaxing.

**What am I planing for my second trip?**

I will start the first days in Tokyo with day trips to Yokohama and/or Hakone and planing a trip to the Fuji Five lakes. I Will travel only by train. After that, I have at the moment those options/ideas in my mind: 

***Option A:Tohoku***

* Fukushima
* Sendai with day trips to Matsuhima, Yamadera and Hirazumi or the Geibike Gorge
* Aomori (if possible to explore the area without an car)
* If there is time: Sapporo and exploring some parts of Hokkaido

***Option B: Kyushu***

* Heading to Osaka or Koysan
* optional: Doing the Shimanami Kaido
* Fukuoka with day trip to Dazaifu
* Nagasaki
* Kagoshima with day trip to Sakurajima or Yakushima

What would you recommend more for that time? Kyushu or Tohoku? 

If it's allowed I can add a photo of my whiteboard with my travel ideas. Unfortunately some parts are in German."
JapanTravel,Help with Hokkaido Summer Itinerary with 3 Young Kids,"First time visiting Hokkaido. We are a family from NYC, but will be spending some time in Malaysia and Taipei before heading to Hokkaido for a few days this August. Current plan is to fly from Taipei to Hokkaido (arriving mid-day on a Weds), stay for 4 nights in Hokkaido, and then fly back to Taipei on a Sunday. 

With 3 young kids (11, 8 and 5), I’m wondering if it makes sense to stay all 4 nights in Sapporo and do day trips to visit Otaru, Furano, national parks, or whether it makes sense to stay outside Sapporo for 2 of the 4 nights. It’s our family’s first trip to Japan, so our priorities are enjoying Japanese food, shopping for cute things with the kids, and doing some easy hikes/walks (would be nice to get some time in cooler weather within Asia). If anyone has any thoughts for a 4-day itinerary, let me know! Thanks in advance."

I’m planning a 21-day solo trip to Japan (second time) from 9th till 29th of September. I’ve already bought the plane tickets as I found a good price for our current times.

I’m fairly traveled, know basic Japanese and am in love with nature, tea and Japanese crafts (mainly pottery) and arts/culture.

For this trip I am going to purchase a 21-day JR Pass and rely on public transportation as much as possible.

JapanTravel,What are items pickpocket target in Tokyo?,"Hello everyone, I have a question regarding potential theft in Japan in particular Tokyo.
I’m currently in Tokyo right now and I worry about pickpocket cause where I lived (Paris) we always have to be careful no matter if you’re a tourist or a local, is it mainly cellphone being stolen but they can go for credit card sometimes, my own mother was a victim of it to give you an idea of what I’m used to.
Tokyo feel so safe compared to Paris, but 
heard since the J.O it’s more common to have that.
I often use my phone to walk around for directions, I feel safe but should I?

I don’t have much on me less than 2000¥ , pocket wifi, passport, my mask and my phone but I worry the most about is my phone.
I have a large coat where all items are in my pockets and I always keep an eye or my hand on the one with money and cause of well Paris lifestyle , so yes I have pocket to put items, I can put the phone inside but I use it for directions a lot so it’s not always there.

What are items I need to be particularly careful with? Or perhaps my phone is more safe to be stolen than my money?
Also I avoid going to touristic area in the afternoon I go either in the morning or later in the day.(and I speak Japanese if you need to know, definitely not like an native but I use Japanese with people more than English and I can read Kana and around 200-300 kanji) 
Also are the pickpocket generally Japanese or fellow foreigners?

Thank you!"

JapanTravel,"Fushimi Inari Taisha, Shimogamo Jinja, Kashihara Jingu","Has anyone been to these shrines? I am looking for a shrine that fits with this description, and with help found those three, still searching:

Festivals or celebrations:

- Kagura miko dance and hold a lot of bells (kagura suzu)
- A big fire where kagura miko with kagura suzu sing and dance.
- Going down some little stairs there's a space of water (river or a lake?) where Nagashibina is celebrated: on the water, you put plate-like circled object made with something like straw, in it there's dolls in traditional clothes in red and yellow, made with paper.

Overall:

- There's long stairs and a lot of greenery/forest.

- There's a big red shrine, kaguraden (I remember two, don't know if there's more), and also very little shrines.

- Somewhere nearby there's a lake or a river because I remember a bridge and Nagashibina, as written above.

- There's many red torii lined up, and there's at least one torii that is made of stone. I remember figures of animals, but I can't remember what they were (I know kitsune and komainu exist, but I feel I remember both). There's many little things in my memories about bells and foxes though, one of them is eating rice that was put inside fried tofu... I think it's called inari parcels, but I read somewhere else that they're called inari sushi, I read they were associated with inari shrines so I wrote it down.

- There should be a place with flowers. I was given one and it is a fond memory to me. The flower was big (for a child) and white.

- I remember a cemetery with grey tall tombstones and a lot of moss/greenery.
I don't know how far this is from the shrine, I just know this was a thing.

The most vague:
- I do remember a brown shrine somewhere but I can't recall if it's maybe somewhere else.

- Inside the shrine there's something round and big.

Dates and extra data: I know 6 of april is important. 1890s or 1980s are also important, but that's just because I have these dates in notes. I did read Kashihara Jingu was built in april of 1890, and that it has flowers, that's one of the reasons I ask about it. Are these dates essential? No, they just may have to do with the place, so I wrote them down. If we talk about when is my description from, think of the 90s and before.

Why am I writing this: I am looking for a place I lived in as a child. I may make a longer post in the future with other locations I remember, but this one is about the shrine is specific. I do speak Japanese but I was only there as a child and do not remember how to say several things, I do nevertheless remember a few things I could write about so I may also make another post solely about dialects and other details like songs I remember and the like. My life has been messy and there's no way I can know where it exactly was, otherwise I wouldn't be asking. I have talked with people who know about Japan better than me in the past that have helped me a little with this, and these are three candidates so far, but there's many things that I don't find information of or that I can't see through Google Maps. The person who told me about Fushimi Inari Taisha used to live near it, so it's the biggest possibility in my mind, but I just don't know if everything fits, and I don't have contact with them anymore. I'm asking online because I'm starting to lose hope if I'll ever find this place. Any information is more than welcome."

JapanTravel,Need help identifying fruit/veggie,"We visited Japan recently and had traditional sushi our first night. It was a tiny restaurant (only like 6 seats). At the end of the meal, the chef served us a tiny fruit(?) for dessert that was similar to a tiny cherry tomato but it was encased in a thin, loose covering. Does anyone know what this is called? I know next to nothing about Japanese culture. Thank you."

JapanTravel,2.5-3 week trip in fall 2023,"Hi! My husband and I are looking to visit Japan again next fall. I've been to Japan a few times before, and we were there together in fall 2019, for 3.5 weeks, so we've seen a lot of the main sites. We're trying to get a sense check for our itinerary, if people have any thoughts. We're both fairly healthy but we'd rather not go by train for too long every day and we'd prefer not to switch hotels (and cities) every night. This trip we'd really love to see a little more nature, and maybe some more onsen stays (we went to Kinosaki Onsen last time and it was wonderful).

With that in mind, here's what we've got so far:

Days 1-2: Land in Tokyo and get over jetlag

Days 3-4: Travel to Nikko, stay there for two nights

Days 4-5: Back to Tokyo and another couple of nights (to not have too long of trains)

Days 6-7: Traveling to Kyoto, thinking of doing Kibune and Kurama

Day 9: Travel to Onomichi (maybe stop at Okayama garden), do the Onomichi temple hike

Days 10: 1st half of Shimanami Kaido by bike (stopping somewhere along the way for the night)

Days 11-12: Finishing the route, going to Matsuyama, staying another night there

Days 13-14: Going to Hiroshima, day trip to Miyajima

Days 15-16: Going to and staying two nights in Kinosaki Onsen

Day 17: Another night in Kyoto maybe, to break off some of the train back to Tokyo?

Days 18-19: Getting back to Tokyo and flying out

I think we shouldn't have any day with more than 3 hours of trains. Things that didn't make it on the list because we weren't sure how to fit them in:

Beppu (and maybe renting a car for a day trip to Mt. Aso), once we realized there isn't an easy ferry from Matsuyama there and it would require about 5 hours

Tsumago and Magome - those seem really nice to visit but it just takes a while to get there...

Very open to hearing any thoughts!"

JapanTravel,Early entrance to Shibuya Sky,"We wanted to go to Shibuya Sky around 30 minutes before sunset later this month but tickets were sold out for that time so we bought tickets for exactly sunset. Does anyone know if we could still enter the observation deck early? Would be much appreciated, thanks!"
JapanTravel,Looking for Outdoor Hidden Gem Recommendations During Late-Spring/Early Summer Trip!,"Hello, I’m planning a trip to Japan from mid-May to early June. I lived in Japan last year, so I had an opportunity to do some traveling, albeit COVID restrictions. I feel like I hit all of the major tourist destinations, but there were a few hidden gems I missed (which has promoted me to return!). I was thinking about extending my trip if there is anything else that would warrant it, so I thought I’d reach out to this sub for any extra hidden gems. 


Prefectures I’ve been to: 


* Tottori 
* Shimane 
* Hiroshima
* Okayama
* Yamaguchi
* Fukuoka
* Oita
* Nagasaki
* Kumamoto
* Kagawa (Naoshima/Teshima) 
* Kyoto
* Osaka
* Aichi (Nagoya City)
* Gifu (Takayama)
* Nagano
* Tokyo
* Tochigi (Nikko)
* Kanagawa (Hakone)
* Yamanashi (Kawaguchi-ko and climbed Fuji-san) 


This trip, the three major sites I’m going to hit this time are: 


* Yakushima (Kagoshima)
* Kumano-kodo (Wakayama)
* Shimanami Kaido (Hiroshima and Ehime)


I love hiking/outdoors, but since I’m going in May, some of the big hikes I want to do (like Haku-san) are not as accessible as they would be during the summer. I’ve also looked into Kami-Kochi, but I’m unsure if June is a good time to visit (generally July-August is Japanese Alps hiking time?) 


Are there any other spots worth hitting in the late spring/early summer? Ideally something of the 2-3 day variety like Yakushima/Kumano-kodo/Shimanami Kaido, but open to other suggestions. 


Thanks so much!"
JapanTravel,Should we include DisneySea in my Japan Travel Plan,"Hi redditors me and a group of friends from Singapore would be travelling to Japan in late march. We were wondering if we should head to DisneySea on 23rd March as it will be our first time experiencing DisneySea. We are contemplating whether to buy the full day ticket or the half day ticket (entering at 5pm) as we are afraid that the queues that day will be very long and we end up spending most of our time queueing.   


Have anyone been to DisneySea recently? and is it very crowded on a Weekday? Hence, any recommendations whether we should go for a full day or half day pass.   


We are a group of teenagers aged 20-25, so theme parks arent a must for us, but we are going there for the experience. Thank you!"

JapanTravel,Ordering a JRail pass voucher - how long until it gets here?,"Hi, I couldn't find info on this, so I hope it's okay to ask here.

Basically, we need a JRail pass to activate on April 3rd. I have been trying to purchase the voucher on the official website so we can also reserve seats in advance (traveling with luggage, so we want to make sure we get nice seats and not stress about it). However it's been down for maintenance for the past 2 days at least.

How long does it take from ordering the pass to receiving the voucher in the mail? We live in Western Europe btw. We leave March 31st. Don't want to make a purchase only to not have the voucher when we leave for Japan. I know I could order it on other sites too but then we wouldn't be able to reserve seats online.

Thanks in advance!"
JapanTravel,2 days between Niigata and Tsunan. Where should I go?,"I’m staying in Niigata (near the station) until 8 March AM, and then have 2 days without a plan until I arrive in Tsunan (via echigo-yuwaza) on 10 March early PM.

I have a JR pass, but am not restricted to it.

Where would you recommend I go?

Requirements:

- can be a different place on nights of 8 and 9 march but doesn’t have to be
- I’m not into winter sports 
- into walks but nothing too too intense
- love to eat unique local foods
- love modern art
- love performance 
- I don’t mind 4ish hours of travel but would ideally rather 1-2h

Thank you!"

currently have four days in Tokyo (dining and sight seeing), then we will do a daytrip in Kamakura and then we are heading to Fuji five lakes area for some resting and Onsen. We wanted to see what advice people have here? Any particular things people would recommend visiting? Would three days be too long or too short? 

Afterwards we are thinking of staying in the Kansai region. We wanted to see some advice here as well. We will be doing Osaka for a couple of days for food and drinks, then a trip to Kumano (any recommend if just a day visit or overnight?). We’ve both been to Kyoto so thinking of skipping it but this is otherwise where our itinerary has stopped and needs to be filled in. I’ve been to Koyasan on my last trip but she hasn’t. Not sure if there’s anything more interesting around there? 

Willing to take any other advice people have on what to add to the itinerary even other locations outside Kansai."

JapanTravel,Japan Central Alps itinerary + road recommendations,"Planning our 16 day trip itinerary for Late May / Early June. 2x travellers in late 20s. 
Will be in Tokyo, Kyoto for ~half the trip + Koyasan and Kumano Kodo for about 5 days.  Plan to spend 3 days in Central Alps with a rental car and would like some advice for this part of the trip.
So far the plan as follows:
Day 0: arrive in Kanazawa in evening, see the old town
Day 1: pick up car rental, drive and explore the Shirakawa-Go village area, visiting Ainokura, Gokayama along the way. Overnight in one of the villages where there is still availability.
Day 2: Drive to Takayam, drive to Magome or Tsumago and do the Nakasendo with a bus return to car. Overnight in the area
Day 3: drive to matsumoto, drive to Kanazawa, leave car and take train to Kyoto in the evening.

Questions:
1. Any scenic roads, towns, villages that would broadly fit into the itinerary that I missed in the outline?
2. I know we are missing Kamikochi, but for this part of the trip we do not want to do much hiking and see nature while driving. Is this a mistake of missing an ‘absolute must see’? 
3. We’re returning via matsumoto because of the castle, but will also see the Osaka castle. Is there a more scenic / interesting option to backtrack to Kanazawa or is matsumoto a must see when in alps and worth the detour?"

Kyoto (6 days)
Osaka (2days)
Tokyo (5 days)

I'm unsure of what precautions to take for them in general, the lack of SIM cards makes me wonder what I'd do if an emergency was to arise. We won't be able to rent a car so we'll be traveling by public transport everywhere. I have kept our schedule very relaxed as I don't want to rush them anywhere.

3. head down to Komogatake (havent rly figured this out but it seems like its walkable?)
4. Komogatake to Odawara. ok this is where i need help. 
i could go down to Hakone-en station via the ropeway, but idk how going back to Odawara is gnna work form here. im thinking of a way to get on the hakone tozan railway but the closest station is on the other side of the mountain. could really use some help here. google maps suggests i take a 65 stop bus ride which is not rly ideal."

I’m just wondering whether it would be worth it to make Osaka my homebase for 8 days and make day trips to Hiroshima and Kyoto rather than staying in Osaka for 4 days/making a day trip to Hiroshima then stay in Kyoto for 4 days. I will be travelling with a carry-on and a check-in as I am coming from my university exchange then taking a flight back home through Tokyo (which is why Tokyo is the second half the trip). 

Is it worth the trouble of lugging my bags around from one city to another (Osaka to Kyoto to Tokyo) if that means I can easily get home at night without having to commute? 

Also, is it worth it to ship your luggage to the train station so the commute is less stressful? I’ve read that you have to book in advance a specific seat on trains to be able to put your luggage in the oversized baggie areas. 

Any advice is greatly appreciated. Thank you!"

JapanTravel,Itinerary Check/Suggestions please!,"So, my husband and I have a little over 2 weeks booked in Japan from 11/5 -&gt; 27/5 and our current itinerary looks like:

11/5 - 15/5 - Tokyo

15/5 - 18/5 - Nagoya

18/5 - 21/5 - Kyoto

21/5 - 24/5 - Osaka

24/5 - 26/5 - Hiroshima

26/5 - 26/5 - Tokyo

We are very excited about this trip, we've both wanted to visit Japan for a while, so we're trying to pack in a lot.  We know the above itinerary is very busy and there will be a lot to pack in, so we're trying to capitalise on the time we have in each location.  We have some absolutes locked in, for example Universal Studios in Osaka (they're our favourite theme parks) and the Atomic Dome in Hiroshima, however the problem I'm having is the overwhelming number of options that are available.  So I guess what I'm asking is, from your previous travel exprieneces in these locations, what are the things that you walked away from and would always say ""such and such is a \*must\* do when you visit""?

Additionally, I do have some specific questions:

1. Mt Fuji - from what I can gather, it'll be closed for climbing during the times we're there, however what's the best way to see it (from land or air), probably as a day trip from Tokyo
2. Hakone - It's my understanding that this is a must do, but I'm not quite sure how it'd fit into our existing intinerary?
3. Miyajimia - is it doable as a day/half day during our time in Hiroshima?
4. Every city seems to have an inordinate number of temples and shrines, is there a source of information regarding what would be the 'best' ones to visit?  (Noting that the definition of best will vary from person to person!)
5. We do like to do a little retail therapy when we're on holidays, any location particularly better than the others for it (clothing, cosmetics and electronics to be exact)?
6. Onsens - We both have tattoo's, which I'm led to believe are generally not permitted in Onsens, we're happy to pay for a private location anywhere we are to experience this uniquely Japanese attraction.
7. LGBT friendly locations is a huge bonus for us!

Budget is pretty open for anything we do, we save hard for our holidays so that we don't feel like we're missing out when we get there!

Grateful for any advice anyone might have, apologies for the long post!"

JapanTravel,Does anyone have a good Resort recommendation with Mt Fuji view?,"Hello, I am going on a trip to Japan in April and I wanted some advice on a good resort stay for one of my days. On April 13th morning I'm planning on leaving Osaka to Tokyo, but was thinking of stopping at an earlier station on the shinkansen to take a day to relax and then continuing to Tokyo on the 14th. I don't necessarily need it to be a full out ryokan but it would be nice to have hot springs and a view of Mt Fuji! Any recommendations are welcome, I'm not sure what exactly I should be shopping for. And a side note, my partner is vegetarian.

JapanTravel,Fast-paced kyushu itinerary needing feasibility check,"Been to Japan one time, in which I did the standard tokyo osaka kyoto etc. type thing   
 by bus with a lot of shrines and castles. My favorite site that time was shirakawa-go, which I took a detour to. Trying to see a lot more nature and the onsens of kyushu this time, indexing less on castles and shrines.  


I'm mostly concerned about whether the itinerary seems impossible at any point, but if you think I'm missing some key poi of Kyushu go ahead and shout!  


a few of the things I looked into, and decided I would skip.

* spending more time in Fukuoka. Fukuoka seemed like one of the less interesting destinations in kyushu tbh, but there were still some things I wanted to see and the starting location is too convenient.
*  spending more time in nagasaki. Since I'm mostly only interested in the history stuff going on, I decided 1 full day + some portions of the day before and after for buffer would be good enough.
* takachiho gorge. I'm not gonna lie it just doesn't look that interesting to me. Hate me for this take I formed over internet photos. But I've seen some waterfall gorge type stuff over the years across different parts of the world and it's just not really my thing.
* doing things in kumamoto. I dunno, it just didn't seem that high ROI.
* visiting sakurajima. I felt like if I had to pick between spending time on aso or sakurajima, I'd rather see aso.

I'll start in fukuoka and rent a car, though I'm not sure of the timing of it. maybe day 2 in the morning or day 1 before they close. Or maybe   


Day 1 

arrive in fukuoka around 11 am from previous destination. see a few POIs, maybe eat at a yatai stall, not much to say here. One thing I really wanted to go to was uminonakamichi seaside park. starting here since it's convenient from my previous location (hiroshima), end in fukuoka. I don't really feel like I need a car this day but it might be more convenient to just do the rental on this day out of convenience.

Day 2

visit dazaifu, see the museum, start heading to nagasaki, check out the pottery towns, end the night in nagasaki.

Day 3 

Full day in nagasaki. end in nagasaki

Day 4 

some buffer in the morning for more nagasaki stuff, then I'm driving to kumamoto via the car ferry at shimabara. I'm considering stopping through a few points in shimabara just to take a gander, but not for anything too long. End in kumamoto

Day 5

Day trip to mount aso. end the day at kurokawa onsen

Day 6

yufuin

Day 7

beppu

Day 8

drive to kumamoto, return the car, JR to kagoshima. (This seemed reasonably possible based on my research) I wanted to return the car here since it didn't seem liked I needed a car for the rest of the trip. Visit some 1 or 2 kagoshima POIs before ending in kagoshima.

Day 9

yakushima

Day 10

yakushima, take the last ferry back to kagoshima. Fly to tokyo (next destination) and stay in tokyo OR just stay in kagoshima and take a flight the next morning to tokyo.

&amp;#x200B;

So, is day 8 actually possible to do? What's a good time to rent the car in fukuoka? It seemed like I didn't even need one to go do things in dazaifu, but I definitely need it before I leave the area, probably right after or by the time I check out on day 2. Anything else here seem amiss? Thanks in advance."

JapanTravel,"Itinerary Check - 14 Days in Tokyo, 5 Lakes, Kyoto","Hi Everyone,

A few friends and I are planning to spend two weeks visiting Japan this September. All of us will be first time visitors. I put together a rough itinerary of things to do and  I wanted to run it by people who have some experience and make sure I didn't pack any days too much.

The four of us are in our late 20's and in decent shape, so walking around for long periods of time is ok. We plan on getting the rail pass for travel between cities, and will either take the subways or walk while staying in each area. None of us speak japanese but I can say a few things and hope to learn a few more before we go.

&amp;#x200B;

Day 1 - Travel. We're coming from the US so pretty much the whole day will be burned flying over.

Day 2 - We plan to fly into Haneda airport. We'll check into our hotel (we plan to stay in Shibuya) and rest for a while. If we're feeling up to it we'll explore around the hotel. Mostly just taking it easy.

Day 3 - Asakusa and Odaiba

Morning - Senso-ji Temple, Nakamise Dori street. Walk to Tokyo Skytree

Afternoon - Skytree viewing platform. Lunch at Asahi Brewery. River Cruise to Odaiba Seaside Park.

Afternoon/Evening - Explore Odaiba. Find somewhere for dinner. Cross Rainbow Bridge and return to hotel.

Day 4 - Ginza &amp; Akihabara

Morning - Imperial Palace

Afternoon - Walk through Ginza (not really into shopping but want to see the area).

Afternoon/Evening - Make our way to Akihabara and do some shopping/hang out there until we go back to the hotel.

Day 5 - Harajuku &amp; Shinjuku

Morning - Meiji Shrine and walk through Yoyogi Park

Afternoon - Walk through Takeshita Street. Maybe go to the art museum.

Afternoon/Evening - Take train to Shinjuku. Find something to eat for dinner and spend the rest of the night going out. Go to Golden Gai, random izakayas, maybe karaoke.

Day 6/7 - Fuji Five Lakes 

We plan on staying two nights near Lake Kawaguchiko. Ideally we'll spend most of the two days visiting some museums, the Fujiyoshida sengen shrine, chureito pagoda, maybe a boat tour. We mostly want to use these days for relaxing so we don't want to pack the schedule too much.

Day 8 - Western Kyoto

Morning - Travel to Kyoto. Check into hotel.

Afternoon - Arashiyama (Tenryuji, Togetsukyo Bridge, Bamboo Groves, Sagi Toriimoto street) and a guided tour of the Yamazaki Brewery if we can get a reservation.

Day 9 - Eastern Kyoto

Morning - Kiyomizudera Temple

Afternoon - Higashiyama District, Kodaiji Temple, Gion

Evening - Have dinner in either Gion or Pontocho

Day 10 - Southern Kyoto

Morning - Toji Temple 

Morning/Afternoon - Fushimi Inari Shrine. Not sure whether we would hike to the summit or turn around before then.

Afternoon/Evening - Head back to rest at the hotel and then get dinner in either Gion or Pontocho (wherever we didn't go the night before)

Day 11, 12, 13 - Back to Tokyo

I thought it may be a good idea to keep a few open days in Tokyo so that we could do anything we didn't previously have time for and to allow for any potential travel delays before our flight home. Some places I wanted to go but didnt add to the schedule are Nakano Broadway and Shimokitazawa.

Day 14 - Go Home

&amp;#x200B;

So that's my first attempt at an itinerary. Would love some constructive criticism, and if anyone has any recommendations on hotels/ryokans, things to add/subtract, or maybe some cant miss restaurants, I would appreciate it. Thanks!"

On my first travel i visited the „standard route“, means Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka, Hiroshima - in every city with some day trips, e.g. to Nara and Nikko. 

Now, as i am planing my second travel to Japan, i am not totally sure what to do. I will spend a few days in Tokyo and plan to a day trip to Hakone and Yokohma. After that i am not sure if i should head to Tohoku and a little bit Hokkaido or the other way to Kyushu.

JapanTravel,Taking Suitcases on Local Trains,"Hey guys, my friends and I have a trip to Japan coming up soon! There will be 3 of us and at the moment we're planning to take a suitcase each - we've got JR passes and have reserved Shinkansen journeys (with extra baggage space where necessary). I was wondering however about shorter local train journeys, and have read that taking suitcases on trains is usually allowed but can sometimes be looked down upon. While staying in Tokyo and Osaka, our hotel is a fair distance from the relevant Shinkansen station, so ideally we would use a local train to get between them, travelling mid-day to avoid rush hour - was wondering if anyone has experience taking local trains in this area with a lot of baggage, and whether there have been any issues encountered? I'm guessing also that Metros are a no-go right? If there will be problems, any recommended alternative ways to do these kind of journeys - e.g. are large Ubers or Taxis a good option in Tokyo and Osaka? Any recommended Taxi companies and so on? Would be great to hear any experiences.

JapanTravel,Itinerary Check - Shikoku → Kansai,"Hello! I’ve been trying to plan this trip in the most realistic way but I’m hoping to have your take on it. I’ve been wondering if getting the Shikoku rail pass would be a good choice, but the problem is that I would only be able to get the 3 day pass while my friend can get the 5 day one. Same goes for the Kansai part of the trip.

Start at Shikoku
**DAY 1: Fly to Matsuyama**
Dogo onsen

**DAY 2 MATSUYAMA**
Garyo Sanso  (I’m thinking maybe we should start using the Shikoku rail pass on this day since it covers the train?)

**DAY 3 KOCHI**
Bus or train from Matsuyama to Kochi 
(I’m particularity stumped on this one because the bus is around 2hr30min while the train is over 4 hours! How?! Like granted if we use the Shikoku pass it pays for itself, but this is a huge gap in time lol. What do you think?)

Kochi Castle and Nishiki Market 

**DAY 4 KOCHI**
Katsurahama (I think train covered by rail pass)

**DAY 5 KOCHI**
Oboke/Iya Valley/Katsurabashi (I think the rail pass also covers the train to oboke)
Train from Kochi to Tokushiman(also covered by rail pass?)

**DAY 6 TOKUSHIMA**
Naruto whirlpools (I think rail pass covers the train to Naruto?)
Bus to Osaka  (can’t use shikoku rail pass)

**To Kansai (other than daily bus passes, should we consider Kansas passes? Also we wouldn’t be able to get the same one…)
DAY 7 OSAKA**
Dotonbori, Osaka Castle, shitennoji, sumiyoshi taisha

**DAY 8 OSAKA**
USJ

**Day 9 KYOTO**
Hokanji, kiyomizu

**DAY 10 KYOTO**

So some questions about certain days:

* For Hakone Day trip, is it realistic to go clockwise around the sites and be able to get to Hakone Yuryo for 4pm start? I've booked for 5pm but they have recommended to start earlier for dinner reservatation at 6pm.
* For the arrival day in Kyoto, have I put too much there? Only Kiyomizudera is a must and I'd like to spend time to do the Tainai-Meguri there.
*  Is the North Kyoto day too packed? Is it possible to start Mt Kurama/Kibune at 13:00pmish say?
* Similarly, is the Arashiyama day too busy? Tenryu-ji is a must, and I don't want to jeopardise seeing it if the Sagano train+Boat ride takes longer than what I think. I could go before, but I think the Monkey Park closes earliest so putting that first whilst its early.
* Is visiting Himeji Castle en-route to Hiroshima sensible, or squeezing too much in here?
* Does anyone know how Yoshinoyama's sakuras flower compared to the forecast? This year it's early so I might be too late for Yoshinoyama to be in full bloom. I can spend another day in Osaka if so.
* Is 12th April in Kanazawa too packed? I've heard it's quite a small city but might be optimistic here.
* Do the Spring Festival activities go on continuously throughout the day? Or will there be time to visit other things in-between things? I haven't made arrangements because I doubt there'll be much time but just wanted to ask. I assume it will be obvious where/when things are going on since I  guess it will be very busy.

I think most of the itinerary is sensible; maybe slightly too busy overall but we're quite quick when visiting places and want to have more stuff scheduled which we can drop when busy rather than wondering what to do next.

Thanks for any advice/help!"

JapanTravel,Question: Neighbors chanting outside at night in Tokyo,"I recently moved to Tokyo and live in a pretty quite neighborhood. My roommates and I are all foreigners, and we were curious about something we noticed our neighbors were doing. They have been going around chanting what believes are the days of the week, like today is Saturday and we are pretty sure they were saying “doyoubi” after they clap together these light sticks that are red and blue twice. There are multiple groups of them walking around the block doing that. It’s men and women around 40 to 20 years old. We also think that they knocked on our window during it. We aren’t really sure what they are doing or if it’s religious. We are just kind of curious of what’s going on if anyone knows."

so in the end of March I will go to Tokyo for about 8 days, nothing booked yet.
I've been googling all day for places to visit and things to do, so now I already have quite a list which I probably won't be able to work all the way through.

But i thought I should ask around here and see if anyone has some recommendations? Everything is welcome from a good restaurant to sights to a shopping street. anything you would recommend I cannot miss out on

The only thing I know I will visit is the Pokemon Cafe since you had to reserve, but other than that I have no plan so far"

I will most likely be exploring the city when they retire to bed.

**8 March (Tokyo)**\- Arrive at 7am. We don't expect much jetlag as there is an hour difference with our home country. Hotel check in is at 1500 so we have hours to kill.- Legoland, Joypolis, Science Museum and hang around the Gundam robot

JapanTravel,Itinerary Check — 1 week in Tokyo! (Early April),"Hi. As the title says, I'll be in Osaka-Tokyo during early April this year but I've been put in charge of the Tokyo trip and I wanted some advice on the current plan I have (it's my first time planning an itinerary) and I'm also open to suggestions since nothing is set in stone yet really. For some basic information, I'll be traveling with 3 family members (all women), and we'll be staying at a hotel in Makuhari, Chiba. I'm aware it'll be at least an hour travel to Tokyo by train which is even more reason why I'd like the itinerary to be more organized. 

Places marked with \* are non-negotiables as they are part of our travel pass. 

TMI: I'm a big anime/manga fan too, so I'd like to go to Akihabara too for sure.

&amp;#x200B;

Arrival at Haneda Airport around noon. (we'll be coming from Osaka)

JapanTravel,"Itinerary Check - Tokyo, Kyoto &amp; Disneyland March 28-April 6 with Child","We are so excited to finally be taking our previously planned Spring 2020 trip. Even better is that what was our 3 year old is a now 6 year old so no stroller or nap and less whining!

I have been reading itineraries for over 3 years planning this trip and I think I have the nerve to post our preliminary one and ask for some advice (please take it easy on me!). It's unfortunately not as long of a trip as we had originally planned but now our daughter is in grade school so we have to follow her spring break schedule.

It will be me (36F), my husband (37m) and our daughter (6F). I didn't really include every single meal since we will probably snack as we find food spots and other than Pokemon Cafe we don't have reservations anywhere special. Feel free to suggest places if you think we are in a good area for a must eat!

&amp;#x200B;

**March 28 (Travel)**

Land at Narita at 5pm.    
Buy IC cards

Head to hotel in Shinjuku

Send husband out to grab some dinner at 7-11? Is that the right place to grab quick food?

&amp;#x200B;

**March 29 (Tokyo)**

Ok I have been torn on what to do on our first day since we will be jetlagged and I don't want to over plan. This could possibly be switched with the next day but in Harajuku we plan on going to a friends taproom and I know drinking with jetlag doesn't mix well.

Wake up early (presumably), Grab coffee and breakfast (recs in Shinjuku or near Ueno? latte art for mom or something fun for kid)

Ueno Park

Asakusa

Kaminarimon

Nakamise Dori (lunch around here or after the temple, dependent on time)

Senso-ji

Sumida Park

Head back to hotel to rest and then maybe go to Shinjuku National Garden in the late afternoon if we aren't exhausted.

Eat dinner in Shinjuku. Husband and I may take turns going out that night and/or the next for a drink in Golden Gai, would it be safe for a woman alone?

&amp;#x200B;

**March 30 (Tokyo)**

Meiji Jingu

Yoyogi Park

Harajuku for lunch and fun shops

Shibuya crossing

Hachiko statue (a MUST for my daughter lol)

&amp;#x200B;

**March 31 (Tokyo)**

Toyosu Market breakfast

10am TeamLab Planets resy

Gundam statue (but do I need to see this at night?)

4pm Pokemon Cafe resy

Pokemon center before or after resy

Imperial Palace grounds before or after resy

These bottom 2 will be switched depending on how much time we have before our reservation

&amp;#x200B;

**April 1 (Kyoto)**

Head to Kyoto

Lunch at Nishiki Market

2pm Tea Ceremony

Check in to Ryokan

Hanamikoji Street

Yasaka Shrine

Maruyama Park for illuminated hanami

&amp;#x200B;

**April 2 (Kyoto)**

Breakfast at Ryokan

Arashiyama Bamboo Forest (early morning)

Nonomiya-jinja Shrine

Tenryu-ji

Lunch

Monkey Park Iwatayama

Would going to Kinkaku-ji after all this be too much?

&amp;#x200B;

**April 3 (Kyoto)**

Breakfast at Ryokan

Fushimi Inari (early morning)

Make our way north stopping along at shrines to Kyoto Imperial Palace

\*\*OR head to Nara for the day, after Fushimi, to see deer?

Head to Tokyo Bay in the evening

&amp;#x200B;

**April 4 (Tokyo Bay)**

Tokyo Disneyland

&amp;#x200B;

**April 5 (Tokyo Bay)**

Tokyo DisneySea

&amp;#x200B;

**April 6 (Tokyo, Travel)**

\*Head to Tokyo for missed things. Akihabara? Viewing deck?

Depart at 6pm Narita

\*Is there anything else we are missing that we MUST do in Tokyo before leaving? I know there are 1,000,000 more things but I tried to keep it to basics that interest us, we will definitely come back again one day, hopefully without our child, or maybe even with the other 2 we are leaving home :-D We have time before our flight on Day 9 so we could go to another neighborhood and put our luggage in a locker (I assume) and explore for a few hours.

Which would you recommend, Tokyo Tower or Skytree?

\*\*I worry that my daughter will get bored of shrines and temples, so I was wondering if it was too much to go to Nara that day after Fushimi and then head from Nara to our Disney hotel in Tokyo. If that is too much, what are some other things we can do in Kyoto before we leave. We are in no rush to get to Tokyo Bay since we are just checking in to the hotel in prep for Disney the next day.

We have a lot of early morning set in our schedule, our daughter (and twin babies that aren't coming) tend to wake up VERY early everyday so it won't really be a change to our normal schedule, don't think we are doing it out of necessity lol. Plus, I have read to go early to certain spots during peak tourism time."

JapanTravel,Does anyone know where/if I’d be able to hear any Enka performers in Tokyo in May 2023?,I’m travelling to Tokyo from May 3rd to May 23rd. I thought I’d be able to see Natsuko Godai but I’m certain it was a viagogo scam which I’m pretty bummed about. But it would be a dream to hear an Enka performance!
JapanTravel,Some questions regarding the planning process,"For context,  I’m wanting to plan a solo trip to Japan, but I have little idea what the actual process of planning one is like because every trip I’ve gone on was planned by other people (who are no longer in my life so I can’t ask them for advice) People always just say “book a flight” “book a hotel” but I don’t know if it’s weird for me to be confused why they say it as if it’s just complete common sense of how exactly to do those things. I have lots of questions that are probably a bit dumb to most people, but I always feel the need to ask a million questions so I can make sure I understand what I’m doing 

What is the process of finding and booking a hotel like for you? I imagine it wouldn’t be a good idea to just find the lowest cost hotel on Trivago and book it. What should I be taking into consideration? Should I look for one close to a train station? What are good websites to find better deals? What are red flags to look out for on these hotel booking websites? 

Similarly, what’s the process like for booking a flight? Is it a good idea to spend time stalking the booking sites until you stumble across a really good deal? How far from my trip should I book the flight? 

What are some dos and donts of putting together an itinerary? If I’m thinking of going to Japan for about a month, should I try to go to as many different places as I can or choose a couple of cities and stay in each for a handful of days? How strict do you tend to be with an itinerary? 

Regarding trains, is it good to plan ahead of time what stations and trains I’ll most likely end up using to go from place to place? Is the Rail Pass really worth it? If I don’t plan on going long distances and will stay generally in one part of the country, would normal train tickets be a better option? 

What are some things that can help me better navigate the cities? Is using google maps reliable in Japan or is there a better option?"

JapanTravel,Tips and help for initial planning,"Hi everybody. I've never been to Japan but it has always been a country I wanted to visit. The period in which I would have time to visit the country would be two to three weeks in June this year. July would be also possible for me but I guess it's not suggested weather wise ? 

I would like to start my journey in Tokyo since I'm flying from Frankfurt. But I am a bit overwhelmed about how to plan the route, there is just so much information everywhere and so much possibilities what you can do. 

Is there some starter advice you could give me? I've been advised to book a Japan Rail Pass Ticket. But what are the areas most worth a visit in June and what is possible to visit in 2-3 weeks? And what budget should I plan for? I don't have a problem with cheaper accommodations and stuff. 

Maybe you could help me with my questions so I can find a little bit of a start. Thank you."
JapanTravel,Do you think it's better to spend a whole month in Korea or to divide it between Korea and Japan?," I've posted the same question to a Korea travel subreddit and now I'm posting it here to consider opinions of both sides lol. 

I have only one month during a year when I can travel those two countries (cause I don't find it worth it traveling for shorter period of time because of the cost of plane tickets). It would also be my first time for both countries.  
I love Korea more than Japan. I'm studying Korean Studies and I have a good knowledge of korean history and culture which I wanna experience first hand.  
I can speak some korean and I hope to try myself on the trip by talking to people there.  
I'm not really interested in clubbing, shopping or going to coffe shops - basically places that are almost the same for every country. I wanna focus on national parks, history places or just famous/iconic atractions. I don't wanna stay in just one province/city but I wanna travel a whole country - as much as I can.

Japan on the other hand is kinda different. I'm interested in Japan (basically grew up watching anime) much longer than in Korea but the interest is weaker. I don't know much about Japan, just some folklore, most famous tourist places and I can speak a veeeery poor japanese.  
If I went to a japanese temple I guess I would be impressed but I wouldn't be exactly sure what I'm looking at without a guide. Regardless, going to Japan is still a big dream to me and I always wanted to travel a whole country, I know 100% I would be extremly dissatisfied staying just in Tokyo or even going to just 3 big cities.

I feel like I would be kinda frustrated going to Korea only while Japan is so close. But at the same time I don't wanna have two medicore trips and end up not seeing everything that I wanted. Do you think it's possible to fit those two countries into one, 1-month trip while one of them is going to be much more thoroughly explored? If you think so, how would you divide them? 50/50? 3 weeks in Korea and 1 in Japan?

I have never planned a trip that would contain that big of a area. Usually my trips were to just one city and now I'm kinda overwhelmed"

JapanTravel,help overwhelmed! 4 week japan travel in october,"So basically my GF myself and a mutual close friend want to travel to Japan around october. We basically just want to book our flights in advance as these prices seem to fluctuate quite a bit and mostly for the worse. 

First question: 
Are there any dates/festivities/natural sights that supposedly happen end of september begin of november we shouldnt miss (for now we are thinking 2nd of october till the 30th) maybe we can move a week earlier/later if recommended!

Second question:
Would it be wise to book hotels/stays in advance or is Japan easy enough to book a new stay in your current stay hotel (so maybe we only book our first and last hotels and decide when and how long we want to go to any place)

Third question;
We want to get a rail pas for the bigger cities, but also want to hire a car to see the snowmonkeys in hotsprings, but also check the less crowded Japanese villages. Would we better finish or start with the rail pas, or maybe start and end, and in between hire a car? 

Last question: 
We have thought about what it would probably cost and made an estimate of around €5000,- per person for 4 weeks everything included, would that do? Or is it not enough to stay for that long with all kinds of sightseeing and good dining, because, you know, japanese cuisine might be our guilty pleasure. (If anyone knows a place where they serve real wagyu beef, we would love to try it once) 

Like i said we are so hyped about Japan that we mind of got an inspirational freeze because theres so much to experience, this might help getting some more steps in. 

Thank you really much for reading up until now and even commenting to help us in our search!"
JapanTravel,Oku-Hotaka and Karawasa advice,"I am planning to hike Oku-Hotaka with my girlfriend as part of our trip to Japan in July. My current plan which I would like advice on is to:

Bus from Matsumoto to Kamikochi in the morning, hike to Karawasa hut, spend the night. 

Next day hike to summit of Oku-Hotaka and spend night at Hotaka-Dake-Sanso. 

Then next day descend and return to Kamikochi, bus to Takayama for night.

How does this plan sound? Also wondering if we should descend via Dakesawa route for a faster descent and new views? Is that possible?

Also, we are planning to leave luggage at locker in Kamikochi and just bring backpacks. Is it ok to do this hike without much gear, just running sneakers and jacket, or do we need helmets and hiking boots? Is there a place to rent these if necessary?

Thanks!"

JapanTravel,OSKA + KYOTO 3days2nights,"HELLO :)

Less than 2 weeks away from my very very short Japan trip before heading to South Korea, and I still do not know how to use the transportation system. I'll only be in Osaka and Kyoto so I've decided NOT to get the JR Pass and the option I'm highly considering is the ICOCA+Haruka Pass they sell at the Kansai airport. 

My itinerary is not yet solid but I DO know that roughly: (I don't need much itinerary help, it's the below questions that are stressing me out)

Day 1: hotel is in Kyoto so we will go from Kansai airport to Kyoto and do some sightseeing 

Day 2: somehow go from Kyoto to Osaka and do sightseeing there

Day 3: Arashiyama and whatever else we missed in Kyoto before going back from Kyoto Station to Kansai airport

So my **QUESTIONS** are (I'm so grateful for this community, I've been watching tutorials for days when I could've just come to Reddit):

1. Is the ICOCA+Haruka the right choice? I know a lot of people take SUICA, Pasmo... and some people have been saying ICOCA covers all trains (except JR) and buses but the website is translated a bit off so it's confusing :'(
2. Does the Haruka cover a round trip (when I first get to Kyoto hotel and when I go back to the airport on the last day)?
3. How do I find the routes ICOCA covers? For example, if I'm at Osaka castle and want to get to my hotel in Kyoto, how do I know which stop to go to, etc.
4. any other advice? 

Thank you so much in advanced, honestly. My parents have me in charge of the whole itinerary but the language barrier is not even my biggest issue-- it's the transportation! Especially because we'll be super busy, having so little time to spend and look at as much as possible. I want to enjoy my trip but it's just a heavy burden so far..."
JapanTravel,Rule of Thumb for items I can bring back through customs/PSA?,"I’ll be traveling to Japan at the beginning of April, and I’m wanting to bring back some goodies and stuff with me. Like records, snacks, etc.

JapanTravel,Where to clear customs?,"I’m reading different information online about where I need to clear customs. Any input is helpful. 

I originally booked a direct flight from the US to Tokyo. Recently, my wife and I decided to start our Japan trip in Osaka, so I added a flight from Tokyo to Osaka. 

We’re flying ANA on both legs, but they were not booked together. We’re only traveling with carryon luggage. It looks like we arrive at NRT in terminal 1, and our flight to Osaka is 2.5 hour later out of terminal 1 as well. 

Do we go through customs in Tokyo or Osaka? If the answer is Osaka, could we choose to do customs in Tokyo to kill time, and then come back into the airport for the flight to Osaka?"

JapanTravel,Itinerary check with multigenerational family - 1 year to 63 years old.,"So , my mom cannot walk much because she get atrial fibrillation. My youngest  is one but a dear, but older one is a naughty brat who can get out of hand. Hence we decided to do all/most sightseeing by private car which isn’t really that costly considering there are 6 of us. 

Now the itinerary:

March 9-16 Japan. 

Arrive at HND at 2130 - transfer by private car to hotel in Odaiba. 

Day 1 : Private car Tokyo sightseeing- the usual suspects - about 8 hours but we will try doing it as long as the little ones ain’t tired - so probably 6! Any routes/recommendations?

Day 2: private tour to Mt Fiji, Hakone. 6-8 hours. Visit 5th station.  

Day 3 : currently free, but migg gf hit do Tokyo Disneyland. 

Day 4: Luggage via courier to next hotel. Take a Shinkansen to Osaka. (JR pass) Should be there by afternoon. Nothing much to do. 

Day 5: Private Osaka day trip. Any recommendations?

Day 6 : JR pass to Hiroshima. Local sightseeing in tour bus that accepts JR Pass. Back to Osaka. 

Day 7 : Shin Osaka to Osaka International Airport. JR pass works right? Which train? Flight is at 10. 
Onwards to Korea! 

Could you recommend as requested? 

Also, any advices - itinerary or for general travel with kids and older generations. 

Thank you!"

ThailandTourism,Bangkok to Poipet borderrun - what are my options?,"I'd like to save money on this trip and do it for less than the 4k that the border run companies can do. I have done this trip in the distant past and I remember it as unpleasant, but not particularly difficult except language difficulties.

From my research, these are my options:

1. Visa run company - about 3500 THB
2. Minibus - about 400x2 THB + 1000 THB (visa) = 1800 THB
3. Bus - about 600x2 THB + 1000 THB (visa) = 2200 THB
4. Train - 2x48 THB + 1000 THB = 1100 THB
5. Casino bus - is it still operating?

How much would you need to spend to go from Aranyprathet to the border? Not more than 200 thb right?

I'm most partial to taking the bus here, since minivans are deathtraps, which buses can be, but I figure less than a minivan. I imagine the 6 hour train ride would be quite exhausting to do both ways."
ThailandTourism,"Paid a lot of customs, can I get some money back when leaving TH?","So I ordered some perfume from the US for $469. This brand is USA exclusive so I had to order from there. The customs (and DHL) pretty much ripped me off, charged me around $270 for customs and fees. I paid it today. I will leave Thailand on Thursday. 

Does somebody know if I can at least get a bit of that money back at the airport? Like for example I bought a watch here 2 weeks ago and will get a tax refund at the airport.

(Please don’t teach me about I should have known better, do my research about customs before and that’s the normal rate etc. I did a mistake by ordering it and paid the price.)"
ThailandTourism,Hotel Booking and stay - doubt | Thailand,"Hello  Redditor

Hope you are all enjoying your lives. :)

I am planning to visit Thailand this month (a 30 days visit ) I can some doubts. 

This is my first international solo trip to spend my vacation trip,  so I did research some forms and articles but I need some clarification. 

Is the immigration asking for 30 days, Hotel booking confirmation, at the Airport?

( My plan is a bit chaotic so I randomly stay in places, Is that ok if I show them 1,2 days hotel booking confirmation? )

some forms mentioned that the on-arrival visa is for only 15 days, how to extend it to 30 days?

Really appreciate your valuable guidelines and advice.

ThailandTourism,FOOD POISONING WHILE TRAVELLING,"Just wondering if anyone else had a similar experience to mine, I had awful food poisoning the night before we were due to check out of our hotel in Phuket. I was with my kid so i asked the hotel could we stay a bit longer as check out was at midday and our flight was at 7pm. 

I was vomiting badly and i pleaded with them to let me stay a few more hours as i was in a very bad way. The manager from the hotel was refusing at first but when he saw me they agreed to move us to a room at the back of the hotel so i could get some sleep before our flight. I spent those 4/5 hours sweating, vomiting and unable to sleep. There was also a festival going on in the hotel grounds and the manager said he didnt want me walking around in front of guests while i was ill. 

Roll on later, i was still vomiting and i got no sleep. It was time for us to leave and i looked so grey and weak at this stage that i thought i was going to collapse. I looked at my kid and i just had to pull myself together. I had a shower, drank some water, vomited and we had a 16 hour flight ahead of us and if i was brought to hospital we would have been separated.

I carried our bags to reception to check out, got the taxi to Phuket airport and put a fake smile on my face as every second that passed i was about to vomit. The staff at the Qatar check in counter asked was i alright, i was worried they wouldnt let us on our flight so i smiled and assured them i was feeling fine. 

Got on our flight half crying as at this stage i was severly dehydrated. They start serving some chicken dish on the plane and the smell of it made me want to vomit. I pressed the blanket against my face just to stop the smell of the food. The embarrassment of vomiting in front of passengers made me resist vomiting. We land in Doha and as soon as i checked the departure screen it said our flight was boarding. I was sweating and desperate to vomit for some relief and i had to plead with security to let us pass before everyone else as our flight took off late from Phuket. I started walking fast towards the escalator presuming my kid was right behind me, i look behind me and he was no where to be seen. I was panicking and i walked back to the security area and my kid was stopped as they wanted to search his bag. 

Security in Doha were nice and they sent him on his way after a few minutes. At this stage we had to run towards our gate. My kid was slowing down and complaining and i snapped and shouted and told him to bloody MOVE!!! We got to our gate C31 and they were boarding the flight when we arrived. When we got on our flight i tried to sleep but i couldnt, the urge to vomit on both flights was so severe but it would have been mortifiying. My kid wasnt bothered, he was served food and enjoyed his movies. I smiled at him and i was relieved we were going home. 

We got home, i started crying, i had a shower and i went to bed. I slept for what felt like 2 days. When i woke up i felt better. Still very weak, incredibly thirsty but i felt better. The vomiting urge had gone. 

Has anyone else experienced food poisoning this bad before? while travelling? I dont think i will ever travel so far again. 

(Just want to say our holiday was amazing up until that point, Thailand was paradise the beaches were stunning, just be extra careful of the food!!!!)"

ThailandTourism,[Need help] How to get best exchange rate for Thai Baht?,"Hi,

I am interested in knowing how does one get the best exchange rate while traveling to Thailand?

Some of the posts I have read indicate people try different methods:

1) Go to Super Rich as it gives the best exchange

2) Exchange at tourist hotspots in the more shady stores (e.g. jewelry stores)

3) Transfer to a local account using Wise (if one has access to a local account that is)

4) WIthdraw from an ATM and choose ""no conversion"", this tends to give the VISA/Mastercard exchange rate, which is close to the mid-market rate.

Please indicate in the comments which method has worked for you and if I'm missing something important."

ThailandTourism,The Best Taxi Driver in Phuket,"Hello all,

I've just returned to the United States after a 3 month trip to Japan and Thailand (Phuket).

However - I wanted to share my story about how I found the best taxi driver in all of Thailand.

Flashback to New Year's week, 2022. I was staying in Patong Beach at an oceanfront hotel with my Japanese girlfriend. Awesome trip, and overall we saw pretty much everything that we hoped we could. Due to the convenient location of the hotel, we were able to walk along the beach daily. During one of these daily walks, we were approached by a taxi driver that was parked along the main beachside road. 

Naturally, he asked us if we needed a taxi for anything. We mentioned to him that we had some plans later in the day but we still were interested in seeing a few sights outside of Patong Beach. This driver, known as Mr. Ka Ka, had a pamphlet already in his hand to show us a few of the popular destinations. My girlfriend and I quickly selected a destination and then I asked ""how much"" to drive us/wait for us/drive us back. Mr. Ka Ka responded, ""500 baht"". This seemed very reasonable already due to the aspect that it was a round trip and he would be waiting for us as we explore. After agreeing on the price, we were off!

Fast forward to after being dropped off, exploring, and returning back to the taxi/driver - Mr. Ka Ka asked us if we wanted to go anywhere else and proceeded to show us the pamphlet again. By now, we still had plenty of time before our previously mentioned plans. We selected a new destination (and mentioned that a second one looked interesting, too). We were quickly whisked away to the next stop.

Fast forward again, Mr. Ka Ka took us to a total of 3 destinations while patiently waiting for us at every stop. By now, it was time to head back in order to make our previously set plans. I told the driver that we may not have time to head back to the hotel and then back out - so the driver suggested that he drop us off (Thai cooking class/restaurant located in the east side of Patong Beach).

As we approached the our drop off destination, I began to wonder what the new total would be for Mr. Ka Ka's additional stops, expertise, and patience. The taxi stops, we get out, and I turned to the driver to ask ""How much do we owe you now?"". Ka Ka responded ""500 Baht"". 

This was a surprise - I really did not expect this due to the significant added time and distance that we were driven (an extra two hours). Perhaps he felt that he could not change our previously agreed price. Well, I was more than happy to triple our agreed price and I handed him 1,500 Baht instead.

TLDR: Mr. Ka Ka is the best driver in Thailand (though there are many other great people in Thailand, too!)

The driver's contact information:

Mr. Ka Ka - 082 989 9060

ThailandTourism,Sanity check my itinerary,"Hey guys! I've booked my flights, can't believe I'm really going to Thailand at the end of the year! I lived there for 3 years when I was young and I've always wanted to go back. Though the Thailand of my memories is from the 90s.. it's gonna be weird, but exciting. 

This is my scheme so far, and I don't want to be lazy but as I've been planning all this while ill I think it's best to double check things with people here before booking hotels &amp; transport. 

I'll be travelling with my girlfriend, we're in our late 20s. Not able to hire a vehicle unfortunately so relying on public transport. We really love nature and are especially interested in seeing different plants, animals &amp; landscapes to what we're used to in the UK. We're also interested in Thai culture and food. So here's what I've got at the moment:

&amp;#x200B;

**Bangkok 24th - 27th Dec.** 

Temples, grand palace, Chinatown, street food, Jim Thompson house, floating market, Icon Siam.

*(fly)* **Chiang Mai 27th Dec - 3rd January.**

Temples, handicraft area, hot springs, orchid farm, Doi Suthep monk's trail, sticky waterfall, elephant sanctuary, Doi Inthanon. 

*(taxi)* **Mon Jam 3rd - 5th.**

Glamping, botanical garden

*(taxi to Chiang Mai, fly to Bangkok, fly to Trang)* **Trang 5th - 6th**

Just enough time to try the food

*(van &amp; ferry)* **Koh Muk 6th - 10th** 

Emerald cave, fishing village, explore the beaches, kayak

*(boat)* **Koh Kradan 10th - 13th**

snorkeling! 

*(boat)* **Koh Ngai 13th - 15th**

chill &amp; swim more

*(return ferry, van to Trang, fly to Bangkok... either train to Kanchanaburi or taxi).* **Kanchanaburi 15th - 17th**

Erawan falls, Wat Ban Tham

*(taxi booked through hotel)* **Kaeng Krachan 17th - 20th**

Birdwatching or wildlife tour, guided night walk

*(taxi booked through hotel)* **Bangkok 20th- 22nd**

Chatuchak market, anything we missed first time.

*(Flight home on the 22nd)*

&amp;#x200B;

Reckon I'll have long enough in each place? Anything you would change? I'm starting to think there's too much time on the islands, but I was looking forward to snorkeling there maybe more than anything. Idk. Also hope I'm not going crazy jumping around too much. There's so much beauty to see. So this is already me trying to reign myself in haha.

Is this a good order to do things in? I'd wanted to do the more active things before the islands, but I'm a bit concerned about traffic around Chiang Mai over new year. Should I still be able to explore the area ok, or should I push Chiang Mai to the end? 

Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks in advance!"

Firstly, obtaining an Import Permit. I have filled out form R1/1 and sent over to qsap_bkk@dld.go.th with all the required attachments. I sent this 3 weeks ago and have tried to chase up a response using same email address but no luck. Is there another avenue I can chase up?

Secondly, actually booking my dog onto my flight. Flying with Thai Airways from Heathrow, UK to BKK. They have zero UK phone numbers which have a person the other side and force you to query through an online form. Did this over 3 weeks ago and have had zero confirmation. Have tried badgering the on socials but no luck. Anyone know of a way to contact their customer services which currently works?"

ThailandTourism,Seeking advice regarding visa run to Malaysia,"Hello, 
I recently extended my visa in Thailand, but was only given 30 additional days instead of the 45 days I was expecting. As a result, I'll need to do a visa run to Malaysia to obtain a new visa.
I'm wondering if any of you have done a visa run to Malaysia from Thailand recently and can share your experience with me. 

Is it possible to fly to Malaysia and return to Thailand on the same day or do I need to spend at least a a night out to receive a new visa ? I’ll only need 30 additional days.

I have a Swiss passport so I don’t need a specific visa for Malaysia or Thailand. 
Any advice or tips you can share would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance for your help!"

ThailandTourism,eVisa still processing with 1 day left before the departure,"I applied for a tourist visa to Thailand for my 90-day trip on the 14th of Feb.  My trip is from March 4(landing) to Jun 1 and I booked a flight as such and provided all the required doc through their EVISA site.  However, I still haven't received the visa as of this morning(I sent an email to the embassy yesterday, but no reply yet).   I am hoping the visa will be issued in time, but there isn't much time left as my departure is only 24 hours away.  So, if I don't get the visa in time, will I still be able to enter Thailand on a 30 day visa exemption?   From what I read, the immigration will ask for the return ticket out of Thailand, however, it's 60 day past the 30 day limit.   Could I be possibly not allowed to enter?   If I were to be allowed in, what are my options in the following two scenarios:

1. Without the visa approval, I enter on the 30 day exemption, I understand you can extend it only once for another 30-day.  Before 60 days, can I take a short trip to a place like Vietnam and return to Thailand for another 30 day exemption?
2. If I get the visa approved after entering Thailand on the exemption, how can I use the visa?  From my understanding, it won't have been used as the visa for entering Thailand.  So, will I have to leave Thailand and come back in order for the visa to be valid for the remainder of the trip?"

As i have been backpacking a lot the past 1.5 years i have racked up 9 entries/extensions, i am getting more and more worried for implications in the future. Reading through the ""[complete visa guide](https://www.locationindependent.co.uk/thai-visas-digital-nomad-guide/)"" (*which all of you should read before asking anything about visas, they explain a lot*) i still have a question about a ""rumors"" regarding staying in thailand.
I remember reading and hearing from fellow travelers (this was during covid times when thailand just started to open up) about a limit of 182 days that you can stay in Thailand for a calendar year, with our without visas. I cannot find the article on this anymore, and the[ site](https://www.locationindependent.co.uk/thai-visas-digital-nomad-guide/) refers to a number of entries by land or air based on a six or 12 month period instead. Is there a yearly limit on days spent in the kingdom or is it solely about number of entrys?

I am curious if anyone knows how extensively checked bags get scanned or searched in layover airports? I'm fully aware of the risks here but I'm skeptical of the actual level of risk I would be taking.

Surely the CBD gummies could be pretty much anything (eg children's gummies) and it's very unlikely the busy staff there will purposefully open a large checked luggage bag just to see if gummies are legal."

ThailandTourism,Thailand E-visa issue,"Hello All,

Here is my current situation:

I am a United States Passport holder currently living in California.

I have a trip planned for next week where I will be in Vietnam for 30 days and then fly directly to Bangkok where I will be for 50 days and then return to the United States.

I have submitted my Evisa to the official website and just heard back today that I need to be flying in ""Directly"" to Thailand from the United States.

This is according to an immigration official I am currently emailing with. This does not seem to be accurate as he has told me I need to apply for a Visa from the Vietnam embassy, even though I am not a citizen. I am currently in a back and forth emails and will call the embassy if it is not resolved soon.

Has anyone else been through a similar scenario and confirm you must fly in directly from the country you are applying from?

If all else fails, I should have no issue getting a 30 day visa on arrival when I arrive from Vietnam and then extending for an additional 30 days correct?"

ThailandTourism,Immigration in DMK and transfer from International to Domestic Terminal,"And to avoid Visa on Arrival, if possible! 

Thanks to all the information provided in this sub. Sharing my recent experience to help others navigating DMK:


Just a quick note on my experience at DMK last week. Inbound travel from a nationality which permits Visa on Arrival. Connecting flight via the same Airline to a domestic destination.

Visa on Arrival (VOA) is a popular option- but you will experience long lines and significant delays. If time is not an issue, and you have a significant amount of time between flights, take this option. 

However, a newer option, the eVoa ( E Visa on arrival), in which you get an eVisa from the Embassy before you leave your Country, results in much shorter lines at Immigration, at least at the time I was there last week, and you are clear to proceed almost immediately. 

If you are on a connecting flight with the same PNR / ticket, and already have the Boarding pass for the next flight, transfers are very fast too."

Any advice on when we should go? Is as terrible as they say? I've seen a couple of websites say its not that bad. Would May be better? Even if it rains a bunch?

ThailandTourism,First time visiting Thailand ~,"My husband and I are doing a late honeymoon to Thailand, we are so excited! I had some details I wanted input on, suggestions, questions, etc. This is just a general first time to Thailand post :)

Budget: ideally would like to stay around $2000 or less, for two people, for 10 days. We are flying out of Korea.

We will be visiting mid-late September. We want to hit the big three: 3 nights Chiang Mai, 3 nights Bangkok, 4 nights Phuket. Should these time frames be adjusted?

Flights I’m budgeting about $1000 (Korea to Thailand and within the country, then back to Korea). Hotels I’d like to stay between $35-$50 a night, so $500 for the whole trip.

Food/day to day activities/travel: $500? 

I’m a penny pincher/budget traveler and my husband is a luxury/convenience buyer. I’d like to meet somewhere in the middle, have a few nice experiences/spend more on some things, though I’m totally ok with eating 7/11 and street food too. Definitely want a souvenir or two (can anyone recommend a tattoo artist ;)?).

Is this a realistic budget? Tips on travel, saving, what to spend on?

Lastly, what are some must do’s for first timers? We like exploring, hiking, sight seeing, bar hopping, dining, really all kinds of things.

I really want to (ETHICALLY!!!) experience elephants, it’s a lifelong dream of mine. Where can I do this? Temples in Chiang Mai are important to us? Maybe Pattaya City near Bangkok? And Phuket, I feel like it’s such a broad area to explore, I’m clueless… but would be happy somewhere with my butt in the sand and clear waters with a drink in hand haha. My husband could care less about the water/beach vibes.

What are things to avoid? I heard scootering is sketchy? What about tuktuks? Is it generally safe/are there unsafe areas? Pick pocketers? Things to know so we don’t get ripped off?

Thanks so much for reading, I know it’s a loaded post with a lot of questions, we are excited to plan!"

ThailandTourism,Bangkok during Songkran,"tldr: would it be worth it to go to Bangkok for a 10-day trip during Songkran or should i reschedule?

hello! i'm planning a trip to Bangkok in April with my father and i had some questions, hope you can answer them! 

right now we have booked our flights from the 5th to the 15th but we could potentially change the dates to the end of april depending on whether my dad can take days off. we decided to stay in Bangkok for the whole trip since we are not staying for that long (which is a shame, but work 🥲).

i was wondering if it was worth it to go there during Songkran as our first time in Thailand? i've seen conflicting infos like ""Bangkok's traffic is dead during the festivities"" OR ""it's so busy you can stay in traffic jams for 3 hours"" hence why i'm here 😅.

i believe most road shops will be closed but will it be the case for other things like temple/museum/zoo/any other important landmark? i've also read that shopping malls are open during that period but that they are extremely busy. i REALLY want to go to Iconsiam though, is it fine to go there or is it a bad idea?

since my father can speak basic thai + is fluent in khmer i'm not that worried about transportations and what not. BUT i may wander alone so from what i gathered : use Bolt (which only accepts cash?) at the airport and Grab everywhere else.

if you have any other advices or if anyone may want to meetup please let me know! i'd love to meet people who share the same interest 🌸 &gt;!i'm in my twenties, live in france and i can speak french, english (with a shitty accent) and a basic mix of teochew and mandarin. what i like: shopping/k-pop/anime&amp;manga/cats/bubble tea and vietnamese iced coffee/home decor. if you have go to addresses related to my basic interests please let me know!&lt;

thank you in advance for your answers!!! 🥰

ThailandTourism,Recommendations for 2 weeks in April in Southern Thailand?,"Hi / Hey / G'day -

My wife and I will be spending 2 weeks in Thailand in the April school holidays. This will be our first time visiting so open to any and all suggestions! So far we've only booked return flights to Phuket. Rough plan was Phuket &gt; Ko Samui &gt; Ko Tao OR Ko Pha Ngan &gt; Phuket -&gt; Home. Really just looking for a braindead relaxing holiday, keeping travel to a minimum, essentially: pool, beach, booze, massage, repeat. 

Looking for places to stay that are hopefully walk-able to good restaurants/bars outside the hotel/resort, happy to spend a decent chunk on accommodation for a few ""lux"" nights (\~24K THB per night).

Also celebrating my birthday coinciding with Songkran!

A few things about us:

* Early 30s
* No kids
* Enjoy bars and live music but not full on club seekers
* Karaoke enjoyers
* Scooter noobs"

I will need to travel from Ko Phi Phi to Bangkok (via air). I wonder if anyone would know which would be the quicker and most convenient way to get to either Phuket airport or Krabi airport.
On initial search, it seems both options would be ferry to land, bus/taxi to airport but what I'm trying to guage is which option would be less stressful and involve less walking or waiting for infrequent busses etc.
The difference in price doesn't matter huge amount to me unless it is massively different (like I would prefer not to pay $100+USD for one option over the other if the convenience is very similar).

ThailandTourism,Koh Larn (and a bit of Koh Phai) or Koh Samet from Bangkok?,"Hi. I'm visiting Bangkok for a few days this week and planning to take a bus to Pattaya to go out to an island, sadly for a day and a half only. I'm from Vietnam and quite similar with tropical islands, so I guess my main goal is to rent a scooter to go look for places along the road/beaches that are on the quieter and cleaner side if possible.

I'm considering between these two options:

- I've heard mostly mixed things about Koh Larn, apart from it being the most accessible, so I'm thinking of nudging Koh Phai in between for the second day morning. It looks beautiful and rather quiet from the pictures I've seen as apparently there's no accomodation on the island.

- Or I would just spend an extra hour or two to go straight to Koh Samet. It also looks great. The only thing I'm worried about is the distance.

Please let me know which one is the better option? Also, let's say I leave either islands at around 3pm. Will I still be able to catch a bus to go back to Bangkok by then? Thank you!

Any other information regarding the two islands is much appreciated."

I'm then going to Samui and Koh Tao, then back to Bangkok. I paid for airport transfer from Bangkok to Krabi  and bus from Koh Tao back to Bangkok. I'm then headed to Vietnam...

Did I get scammed and paid too much?"
ThailandTourism,Headaches in Thailand … is it because of air pollution?,"Had bad headache both nights in Bangkok towards end of day, but always woke up feeling fine. Now I’m traveling to Chiang Mai and wearing a KN95 mask. Could my headaches be from the pollution? I know it’s burning season, will Chiang mai be worse or is the smog of the city worse? Will wearing this mask help? Any advice appreciated 🙏🏻 kawpkoon ka in advance"
ThailandTourism,Recommendations on how to split time in Phuket?,"I’ve been trying to plan a big trip for my birthday and decided on 14 days split between Phuket and Bangkok. I feel like I’ve got a pretty good grip on the Bangkok half of the trip, but the Phuket half has me banging my head against the wall. I’ve never left the states before and I’ve been trying to gather as much info as I can, but it just feels very overwhelming. 

I was originally considering spending 7 days in one hotel around Karon/Kata and just commuting when need be, but I’m wondering if it’d be better to split my time there up? Like I said, I’ve never travelled overseas before at all and so I’d be so grateful for some recommendations or advice. The sheer amount of information available, some of it conflicting, has just been a lot to take in. I’m more of a slow traveler and like to take my time places, but I just worry about overestimating it and after the fact feeling like I could have done more. 

For reference, it’s me and 2 girlfriends. We’re looking more to relax and do some sight seeing and whatnot around Phuket. We were planning on saving any partying for Bangkok, but we’re not going out of our way to avoid the party scene in Phuket if that makes sense. We’re not really going in with a full day-to-day itinerary, just some general ideas and a few things planned ahead. I’m so sorry if this is scattered and all over the place, none of the three of us are really great planners and it being my birthday, the task was assigned to me. If any more info would be helpful, please just ask. Thank you in advance!!"
ThailandTourism,Recommendations for a Relaxed Beach Destination near Bangkok?,"I'm currently in Bangkok and looking to spend some of my remaining days at a beach. I'm not really into the wild party scene like Pattaya or Phuket, but I did enjoy Hua Hin. I'm looking for a place near Bangkok that has a similar vibe to Hua Hin, or I may go back there if I can't find something else.

Does anyone have any recommendations for a beach destination that has a relaxed and laid-back atmosphere? And if so, how would you recommend getting there from Bangkok? I'm open to taking a bus or train, but would also consider hiring a driver if it's a good option.

Thanks in advance for your help, and I'm looking forward to hearing your suggestions!"

ThailandTourism,Chiang Mai for 1.5 days,"Hey all! 

I'm going on a contiki trip to the south of thailand in a week, but I have about 2 days in thailand before I head back home. The tour ends in phuket.

Would it be worth it to travel to chiang mai in this time? I don't really want to stay in phuket because I feel like I'll have seen most of it. However the flights to chiang mai is pricey - almost $200 and I would only be there for 1.5 - 2 days.

Chiang Mai seems so awesome but should I just save it for another trip? Are there any other places close to phuket I should check out? (I'll already be seeing ko phi phi, krabi)"

ThailandTourism,Chiang Mai Itinerary,"We have about 3 days in Chiang Mai in early June. We've got a cooking class our first afternoon/evening and then elephant sanctuary and city tour our last day. 

We were originally thinking we'd like to see Chiang Rai the middle day but I'm starting to think that's just going to be too far to go and won't be worth it.

Our tour operator has suggested a full day trip to Doi Inthanon as an alternative.

We'll have a private driver and guide for whichever tour we do.

Or something else with that day?  We'll have just come from Bangkok and Siem Reap so between those, we'll be seeing plenty of temples.

Are there any apps that are good for this sort of thing? Or places to go? 

I was looking at hostels but they seem to be mostly party oriented so I'm not sure I'd find the right sort of people there since I don't enjoy partying much.

I'll be around Krabi area.

ThailandTourism,Advice for changing my return flight?,"I'm about 12 days into what was scheduled as a 44 day trip through March 29 under the visa waiver from the US.  I'd planned to hit Cambodia and will still do that around March 18-24.  However, I'm enjoying things so much that now I am thinking that I'll stay longer and wander around Thailand a bit more.  As I understand, the visa waiver will reset to another 45 days on re-entry from Cambodia?

Assuming I am correct, my question is, which is cheaper - to reschedule the return flight now to late in April?  Or might this get cheaper closer to the original March 29 departure date?  When I checked today it would cost about $540 more to extend the return flight 30 days or so.

TIA."

Just wondering if this is true as I don't want to pay with my card then find out I can't use the voucher.

ThailandTourism,"UK Visa, Vegan/Vegetarian Eating, Budgets &amp; Socialising","Hi all, 

I have three questions, answers to any number of them, even if just one, is appreciated.

1. UK Visa
2. Vegan Vegetarian... and Gluten Free 
3. Budgeting &amp; Cashpoints
4. Socialising

**UK Visa - 45 days, 90 days... 6 months:** 

I am slightly confused about the visa exemption offered to UK passport holders.

I am planning on living in Thailand for around 6 months, however am seeing mixed advice between different termonologies, 'visa on arrival' and 'visa exemption'.

From what I've read and understood, as a UK passport holder, I can leave and re-enter Thailand as many times as I want in a year, and I will continue to get a 45 day exemption each time I  leave and come back (with only two allowances through land borders each year).

Have I got the right end of the stick here, or am I still prohibited by upto 90 days in a year, somthing that I can only see as applicable to 'visa on arrival' passport holders?

**Vegan Vegetarian... and Gluten Free:**

I bounce between a vegan and vegetarian diet when I am travelling.

For the most part, I want to keep this trip at a: street food eating, chilled out, relax a little level.

What is the availability of vegan and vegetarian street food, that would also be gluten free? 

I have heard of a thing called 'Jay Fai' food, which is all naturally vegan in Thailand, but apparently availability is scarce. Is there any paticular place that I should be looking at to find these street food priced dishes? 

I plan on travelling primarily between Bangkok, Koi Samui, Krabi &amp; Ching Mai; I also may have to go and visit a friend in Pattaya.

**Budgeting &amp; Cashpoints:**

The last time I was in Thailand, only in Bangkok, I was spilling around £3000 (\~$3600) a week; at that time however, I was partying every other night, eating at posh resturants and smoking around 30 cigarettes a day.

***Now*** I don't smoke, I don't drink alcohol and I am on an intense fasting schedule,in which I only eat every other day (I eat and drink for 15 days each month) - I also don't really have a lot of accessible cash anymore.

My diet mostly consists of whole vegan foods (fruit, vegetable and lentils) . 

Most of the things I want to do in Thailand revolve around meeting new people (I will be staying in hostels this time around) , continuing to eat well, see a few historical places, play pool with the lads and to have a few flings.

What sort of budget should I be looking at to fulfil the above\^ 

Last time I came, I also remember money being a real pain in the arse, with outrageous bank charges to get my money out (something like 8 quid per transaction, maximum £200 withdrawal each time + exchange fees + ATM fees), is this still the same? If so, what's the best way to get around this. Getting a travel card isn't really achieveable at the moment (unless it is?) as I am currently in Goa, India and have been living here for the last year.

**Socialising:**

Additionally, with meeting other people, I spent most of my time socialising at bars and clubs last time round; what is available for individuals like myself who don't do that stuff anymore - I repeat, no smoking and no drinking?

**Thanks for all input in advanced! :)**"

Figured I would take him up on the deal and when I sat in his Tuk Tuk he pulls out a brochure for a suit store that I need to stop in for five minutes and I am not required to buy anything.   
Let him know that I had zero interest in buying suit and I would not want to go to the store.

ThailandTourism,Hostels Bangkok for 22M,"Hey all, 22M Solo Traveling to Thailand from Australia in May with my First Stop In Bangkok. As Such, I was looking for accommodation and figured I would give Hostels a go given their social nature. Without sounding too picky Im looking for a place that is social enough but still hospitable. I love to party and I intend to go out most of the nights I'm in Bangkok, however, once I do eventually get back to the Hostel id prefer to come back to something nice. Additionally im in fortunate enough of a position to only be considering the private room options. Sneaking around in dorms seems like too much work if you know what I mean. Another important factor would be location. Ive been to Bangkok before and am familiar with the MRT and BTS. So ideally id prefer a place close to a station.

ThailandTourism,Thailand Weather in May,"Hey All. I am currently in the midst of planning a trip to Thailand for the month of May. However, I find myself curious about the climatic conditions that vary across the various regions of the nation during this time period. To my understanding, May falls in a transitional period between Thailand's hot and rainy seasons, with the weather differing across the nation's regions. I am particularly interested in exploring the northern region of Thailand, encompassing the cities of Chiang Mai, Pai, and Chiang Rai, during the beginning  of May. However, I am concerned that this timeframe may coincide with the country's burning season, so I question whether this would still be an opportune time to visit the north. Additionally, as I progress further into the month, my itinerary will include a visit to the southern region of Thailand, encompassing the many stunning islands within. My inquiry regards whether there is a notable difference in weather between the eastern islands, such as Ko Samui and Ko Pha Ngan, as opposed to the western islands, such as Phuket, Krabi, and Ko Phi Phi. If so, which region boasts a more favorable climate during the month of May? Thank you in advance!"

Ultimately I am hoping to get a mix of mountain / natural wonder + island / ocean - Ideally avoiding major tourist areas (with the exception of Bangkok) However, the more isolated the better..

ThailandTourism,Full Moon Party in Phuket?,"Hey guys, On the day of the full moon party I'll be staying at Phuket. I didn't have time in my itinerary to go to Koh Pha-ngan so I wanted to know if there's going to be any special parties in Phuket on that day?"
ThailandTourism,2 days in Koh Lanta and 2 days in Phi Phi?,I have already booked my accommodations and a set itinerary. However I keep seeing videos of Koh Lanta &amp; Koh Yao Noi/Yai. My partner loves snorkelling and I think the Lanta to Koh Rok boat tour is perfect for him. So I am deciding to maybe split the 4 days of PP into 2 days of Koh Lanta and 2 days PP. Is 2 days in between enough? The boat ride from Koh Lanta to PP is only 45 minutes. My last destination is 3 days in Phuket in which I would definitely sacrifice but my aunt's husband's sister (lol) is showing us around plus our flight to go home will be there.

Will we need to take 2 cabs or are there minivan taxis that will fit us and our bags?  Assuming they exist, how easy are they to find or arrange, and is the cost of a minivan taxi much more than a regular cab? 

Many thanks!"

ThailandTourism,Today I say Thank You to this Reddit community.,"I landed in BKK late last night for my first ever trip to Thailand, go to the taxi stand, get my number, wait for my taxi. First impression when he pulls up is, gee something looks off, all the other taxis are shiny and nice, this one looks like it was in a high-speed car chase. Anyway, don't be an asshole and judge a book by its cover, walk over he opens his trunk, there's tons of junk in there already, he quickly grabs my wife's bag tosses it in and closes the truck. Then asked where we're going. I show him both in Thai and English. He acts confused for a second then types on his phone 600. Says I'll take you for 600. I said no, meter only. He says no no no 600, no meter!!! I instantly started thinking of this Reddit, stay calm insist on meter, shit just get your bag back and get a different taxi. I repeat meter only, he's really starting to get pissed off, he starts complaining that we have two bags, we want to go so far, we have to pay 600! So I start to want to get heated too, but, again, I hear this community, never raise your voice never cause a scene. So I start insisting firmly but not loudly give me my bag back, over and over. Finally, he gives it back, I grab our bags and head back to the taxi stand for a new ticket. The attendant ask why I'm back, I said taxi wouldn't use the meter, so I'm back for another ticket and proceed to use the kiosk. She gets instantly upset, and ask for my original ticket, I said he kept it, she gets visibly more upset and ask which stall, I say 34, she says come with me and takes the new ticket that just came out of the machine. She marches over to the main taxi office and ask how much he wanted to charge, 600, she starts talking to all of the ppl in the office, they're all starting to get loud and seem bothered. About this time taxi driver comes up and starts loudly giving his side. Again she ask where I wanted to go, and how much he quoted. Everyone is yelling at this point and I'm just going, oh shit don't cause a scene, which I didn't want to do, but she was mad at this point and starts reaming the taxi driver. And the ppl in the booth are yelling at him, I'm really starting to get worried, never cause a scene after all, I lean in and quietly say I'm really sorry for the trouble, can I just get another taxi and go, she says you need to file a complaint he can't do this, I said no really I don't want any trouble, she smiles sighs and let's me go. Last I see, that guy is getting reamed by a half dozen staff and the police were headed over. I just went and got a new taxi and left. 

I know this is long and I'm still leaving out lots of the back and forth between everyone, and maybe it was all theatre, but it was nice the staff seemed to care and have my back. 


TLDR: airport taxi tried to scam me by not using the meter, thanks to this community, I stood my ground, didn't cause a scene, on my own anyway, and got an honest taxi that used the meter. Cost half as much in the end."

ThailandTourism,Thailand in August?,"Hey guys,

I have planned a trip to Thailand in early august and was wondering if it would be worth it? 

Im open to to travel to different islands and places like Koh Samui, phuket and pattaya. Right now my plan is land in bangkok and spend 5-6 days there, fly over to another destination in thailand and spend 7-8 days there and fly back to bangkok and have 1 rest day there before flying back.

What Im worried about is obviously the weather, I have read around and it seems like Koh Samui is sheltered from the rain quite a bit in august is this true? Im looking for a place with not too much overcast/rain with beach and sunny days. From what Ive read Pattaya has 13 rainy days in august and 100mm of rain and phuket has 17days and bangkok has 220mm or 20 days. So far my plan is bangkok 3-5 days and then head to pattaya the rest of the trip. 

Would this trip be worth while guys?"

ThailandTourism,Need feedback/suggestions on my itinerary,"Hello everyone, I will be staying in Thailand between the 18th of March and the 19th of April. Will be traveling solo and its my first time in Asia. I'm looking for a mix of somewhat touristy + quieter destinations. Not looking for crazy partying (not interested in the Full Moon Party, Phuket, etc). Not interested in big resorts/luxury holidays. I'd like to dive, hike, see amazing nature, relax on the beach, take some cooking classes, and just go with the flow and see what I can do once I'm there. This is the rough itinerary I thought of (tried to pick islands that wouldn't be too difficult to get to, considering that I only have 1 month and don't want to rush too much):

Day 1-6 - Bangkok  
Day 6-12 - Koh Samui  
Day 12-17 - Koh Phangan  
Day 17-20 - Koh Tao  
Day 20-26 - Koh Lanta  
Day 26-31 - Koh Jum  
Day 31-32 - Go to Phuket and take a flight out of there to Hong Kong (Phuket just because it seems to be easy to get to from Koh Jum and there is a nice flight to HK).  


Based on what I'm looking for, does this itinerary make sense? Are there any other islands you would recommend me to visit instead? I was also looking at Koh Chang and Ko Racha Yai but it's so hard to choose."

ThailandTourism,First impressions of Phuket,"So I’ve been here a few days now and visited much of the west/south west of the island. Before I came I had lots of questions so here’s what I’ve found out as I’m sure it may be useful for others coming over here. 

Smoking (tobacco) - you can still smoke pretty much everywhere in spite of the new Thai law changes. Even most beaches have smoking areas. 

Jellyfish - I’ve been to Kata, Karon, Nai Harn, Kamala, Patong, Surin and Bang Tao. Haven’t heard or seen anyone being stung by jellyfish and I haven’t experienced it myself. 

Towns:

Patong - absolutely mental. Chaweng x 100 haha 
Karon - popular with families. Feels quite large. Long beach front but feels a little developed and sterile. 
Kata - I prefer to Karon. Beach is smaller (still pretty big) and it’s pretty busy but the town is smaller and easier to walk around etc. Some good bars. 
Kamala - older crowd. Town is much more chilled and pretty small. Beach is nice, busy but nice. 
Surin - lovely beach, not much of a town. 
Bang Tao - part of it is like a Disney resort, the other part is like stepping back in time haha"
ThailandTourism,Suggestions for place for older parent looking to visit,"I am currently backpacking India and South East Asia for 5 months. My mother would like to take the opportunity to visit a part of the world she has never been to and possibly meet me in Thailand near the end of May. I am looking for suggestions for areas that would suit. I am backpacking and staying in cheap hostels and picking places for convenience and price, but I am looking for somewhere for a week or two that suits her too.

We are Irish, so the less hot the better. She does yoga at home for a year or so, not incredibly experienced but she enjoys it so I was thinking some sort of yoga retreat that caters to beginners. Somewhere accessible to an airport without too many transfers would help too.

If anyone has any suggestions that would be amazing, thank you!"

ThailandTourism,"Lived in Thailand for 8 months, love it. Love the Thai people. I’ve experienced 100% politeness from the locals at all times, apart from people in 1 profession:","The people who work at piers when you travel anywhere by boat, be it those who work in the ticket offices or those that usher you onto the boats themselves - ferries, longboats, etc. 

There’s always an edge to these conversations. I’m always extremely polite to the workers, yet I’m always given half-answers or waved away. Met with a lack of eye contact like they’re frustrated at even having to engage with me. 

I don’t understand. This seems entirely at odds with the Thai culture - everybody else is unwaveringly polite, apart from these people, who’ve made it their job to organise the arrivals and departures. I’ve travelled by boat around 10-15 times and this is always the case; they adopt this tone with everyone. Why? I can’t work it out."

ThailandTourism,Best Marriott Hotel Beach in Phuket,"I'm a Hyatt Globalist that plans on collecting elite nights for a couple of weeks at The Racha. But I need to switch over to Marriott for a week. I see a lot of positive reviews on the following Phuket hotels:

* Le Meridien Phuket Beach Resort
* JW Marriott Khao Lak Resort &amp; Spa
* Le Meridien Khao Lak Resort &amp; Spa

Primary factor is a nice looking and not so busy beach at a relatively good value (I'm also Marriott Titanium if that factors in the decision). Has anyone been to most or all of these hotels and have a favorite one?

Naka Island looks very serene, but the beach doesn't look as beautiful from what I've seen.

Already canceled the Phi Phi boat tour. Still going to an elephant sanctuary. Going to beach clubs and Patong. 
- Any other activities I should add to take place of what was supposed to be an all day boat tour? Things to avoid? Should I just lay on the beach all day?

2. Duration of your trip and average spend per day (excluding pre-bookings)?
3. What were some problems faced while making payments (and/or) obtaining local currency in Thailand? (e.g. ATM charges, Card usage charges, bad exchange rate, etc., etc.)
4. How, if anything, did you try to solve those problems?
5. What, if anything, don't you love about the solution you tried?

Thanks!"
ThailandTourism,Island hopping day trip in Thailand,"My husband and I are going to Phuket in March and we want to find a hotel to stay out for about 4 or 5 days that will allow us to island hop and see multiple islands over the course of a few days via tour. Some of the tours say they'll pick you up from your hotel, but i'm not sure if that's based on wherever you are. Based on where each port is located, I'm not sure where we'll have the most island access. I was looking to stay between Talat Yai and Talat Nuea to give be closer to multiple ports. Any tips on which area is worth staying in to see the most islands? Thanks!"

ThailandTourism,8 week north east loop,"Hello. I'm travelling late March to Thailand &amp; planning on doing an 8 week stint in SE Asia. I plan on going north from Bangkok to Vietnam &amp; back to Bangkok.
I have several questions re. visas;
1) Although I'm permitted 45 days in Thailand, I plan on spending 60 days out of the UK.
Therefore, do need a visa despite spending less than 60 days in Thailand? I plan on spending time travelling Vietnam &amp; potentially Cambodia.
2) What is the best entry to Vietnam? Is it via bus or flight? I have seen flights are a popular method, particularly from Cambodia.
3) I plan on visiting islands both off Thailand and Vietnam but am unsure on whether to get vaccinated for rabies, has anyone got any tips?
4) Is there anything I might not know that I need to prior to travel?
5) Is going north of Bangkok first the best option? Am I better off going anti-clockwise from the south?
TIA. I appreciate the advice."

ThailandTourism,"Reserving accomodation in advance, how much and should I do it anyway?","Hi,

I'm doing 4 weeks in the eastern islands in Thailand in March/April. My general plan is one week in Samui, one week in Phangan, one week in Tao, and then last week back to whichever one of those 3 was the most interesting or fun.

I'm aiming for bungalows or upscale hostels.

My question is - should I pre-plan and pre-book my accommodations or am I okay just driving around and winging it during the actual vacation? I've been looking at some places on Booking but they ran out of space for those dates in like a week between the two times I looked, so I don't know...

ThailandTourism,From Krabi Airport to Koh Lanta Hotel,"Hi Everyone,

I'm struggling to find the answer I'm seeking.
I see I can book a minivan for 380 bhat on 12go, but the time is very approximate because they actually start by picking people at the hotel so you never know when they will arrive at the airport.

I'm landing at 2.50pm 

There are three options : 
- Booking the 1.30pm minivan but it might arrive way before me
- Booking the 3.30pm minivan but I will arrive way before them
- Getting a ticket at the airport and hope there are more companies/minivan operating ?

I know I could rent a private taxi but the price difference is pretty steep :)
So if anyone has tips regarding this I would be grateful :D

Thank you everyone :)"

ThailandTourism,Bars &amp; Clubs that don't allow or want Indians?,"I am 25 years old and travelling solo to Bangkok, Phuket &amp; Pattaya(burning season in North so skipping it) in March. I am yet to book the tickets but I have read a lot of posts on reddit &amp; elsewhere that Indians are the least preferred tourists in Thailand and are banned from a lot of gogo bars and clubs. This has created a strong doubt in my mind &amp; am thinking that perhaps it would be better to choose another destination like Vietnam to just take a break.

The stereotypes that came up were that Indians are:

* **Loud** \- yes some of us may be loud in groups but thats usually not a problem with me as I am a quite talker and I'll be solo anyway.
* **Haggle a lot -** I suck at it. I can hardly recall any instances where I've done that even in India. I just prefer to walk way if the price is too obnoxious xD
* **Disrespect women -** I don't know about this. It might be a problem with the older generation people but I don't think most of the younger people do that.
* **Smelly** \- All people that I know including me always wear deodorant but if its the food that we are talking about, then thats a lost cause as we can only clean up after ourselves post meals but we can't change our cuisine xD. I tend to eat less Indian food outside the country though but obviously I start craving for it if I haven't had it since a while.
* **Cheap** \- I can't say about all Indians but for me, I usually don't care much for money while I am enjoying. But obviously, if I am hitting multiple bars in 1 night, then I can't drink like 2-3+ beers every where so that I don't get fucked up. 

I have also read that some bars have sign boards that say ""Indians not allowed"". It would be so embarrassing as well as enraging to have to read that sign if I ever walk past them. I also read that some clubs ask Indians for money upfront as deposits to discourage us from coming in.

 I also don't want to enter any bars where one of the hostess is kinda forced to cater to me even if she doesn't want to cater to Indians just because of the bar rules of attending the customers. It would suck for that girl as well as me too. I don't want anyone to have to cater to me against their will just because I am giving business to their bar owners. 

Does anyone has any experience about this or know of any gogo or normals bars that I should avoid. Or would it better to just skip Thailand altogether?"

ThailandTourism,"Railay, Koh Lanta, both?","Hi

Thanks to lots of help on here I am pretty set on the following options for a 3 week honeymoon in Dec/Jan.

Bangkok 3 nights

Chiang Mai 3 nights

Phuket (Four points Patong) 6 nights

Railay (Rayavardee) 3 nights

Ko Lanta (Layana) 4 nights

Basically decided splitting the trip 3 ways - 1 week cities, 1 week busy beach resort (I know Patong gets alot of bad press on here but I researched and found four points hotel as a perfect spot between crazy busy and calmer) and 1 week relaxed beach resorts.

My question is am I doing too much and losing lots of time with travelling?

I would love to stay at both Railay and Lanta but if I had to drop one it would probably be Railay as from what I can see there are a lot less food and drink options so 3 nights would probably be enough there. Would this be a better option? By not staying in Railay I would miss the beautiful beach there and trips to the 4 islands, is that a big thing I'm missing out on or are the trips I can do from Phuket just as beautiful (maya, James bond island Similan)

Also am I better off staying in Kamala and taking taxis to Patong at night? Conscious of the russians post recently on here and Kamala may be more diverse mix of tourists?

Thanks!"

I believe Thai immigration allow tourists with the exemption and a longer return date under the assumption that they will get a visa extension at a Thai embassy. 

I just need to find out whether my airline, Finnar, require proof of onward travel, or if the return ticket is enough.

I booked a hotel which looked quite nice and bright and thought I'd splurge on a deluxe room for 21 nights (about 900$ CAD!!!)  on booking.com and it is WAY off from the pictures , very dim. the pillows are stained yellow with no pillow cases , the towels they left for me were covered in dead bugs , the ceiling in the bathroom is moldy and falling apart, it's super dusty and old, It's missing key furniture pieces from the pictures including a table and chairs which I needed. 

After looking more I'm finding places that are twice as good for literally 500$ CAD a month. is there any way I could contact my bank from abroad (RBC if it matters) , deduct the cost for the 1 night I did stay and get a better place ? This honestly feels like fraud / a scam.

ThailandTourism,What to put as 'intended date of departure' for METV?,"I'm looking to get the multi entry tourism visa and try to maximise my stay on Thailand for that for the 6-9 months depending on the extensions.

During the e visa process, it asks for intended arrival date and intended date of departure. 

So far there has been no mention of 2 months or 6 months or anything like that on the portal and it's allowing me to set the departure date at any time in the future which obviously isn't correct. 

I am wondering - what do I put as the intended departure date? A date of 6 months from arrival date? Or a date of 60 days?"

ThailandTourism,Another visa run post...,"Hi Thailand tourists,

I am a US citizen currently in Thailand, and my 30 day extension (after the 45 day entry) is up on March 8th. I plan to go to Vietnam from 8/3 to 1/4, and re-enter via a flight through Bangkok. My question is: can I apply for the 60 day tourist e-visa through \[this\]([https://www.thaievisa.go.th](https://www.thaievisa.go.th)) website? Or can I only do that from within the US? 

Also, as part of the application, I need to submit the last 12 months of passport pages which, if I did it right now, will show that my last stamp is the 30-day extension for Thailand. Not sure if that would be a problem or not.

Alternatively, can I apply for the 60-day visa at the Thai consulate in Ho Chi Minh City, or is that only for residents of Vietnam? It was unclear on the consulate website. 

I'm pretty sure I'd be ok to re-enter for another 45-day exemption, since I've never done a border run before and I am staying in Vietnam for a few weeks. But I'd like to get the 60-day stamp this time if possible. 

One more question: if I do successfully get a 60-day stamp, do I qualify for a 30-day extension on top of that, or are those only for when you have a 45-day exemption? Again, online info is unclear. 

Thank you!"

ThailandTourism,One month stay in Bangkok,"Hello fellow Redditors!

I went to Bangkok in January for about three weeks. I would love to go back there again in a few months, planning to stay for a month this time around. Previously, I was staying in an apartment for two weeks and then a hotel for another week.

This time around, I would prefer to stay in one place without moving. I am thinking of using Airbnb to book an apartment. However, I heard that Airbnb is illegal although I heard people have used it even for short term stay. But a one month stay, will it be okay? Or will it be better for me to book through Agoda?

If you have any other recommendation, I am willing to explore as well. Thanks for all your help! :)"

ThailandTourism,Itinerary feedback,"Hi everyone! I am traveling to Thailand for the first time with my boyfriend in December.

We are both not into partying and want this to be a more laid back relaxed vacation (which is why im not sure if our island choices are the best). We really enjoy lounging on the beach and dont want to spend too much time in transit if possible. 

**Bangkok-3 nights**

**Chiang Mai- 4 nights**

**Krabi - 3 nights**

**Phuket-4 nights w/ day trip to koh phi phi  (flying back to the states from phuket)**

I have a few questions:

1. Is the number of nights sufficient for each spot?
2. should we switch koh phi phi with krabi or is day trip sufficient?
3. Im hearing a lot of negative things about phuket on this sub and wondering if it is worth staying 4 days?
4. Are there other islands close to phuket (&lt;5hrs of travel) that are worth visiting instead of the Krabi region or koh phi phi?

thank you!!"

- Head to Khao San road

Day 2.

-Morning run is Lumphini park
- Good coffee shops (recommendations)
-Would like to take a water taxi to somewhere to get food
- Is the trip to the train market worth it? (Could be a whole day right)
More temples if we have time

ThailandTourism,Is Khao Sok National Park worth a day trip from Krabi?,"My girlfriend and I (29F/35M) are headed to Thailand in late March through early April for a 12 day trip. We're flying into Chiang Mai (4-5 days) and then head to Krabi (4-5 days) and Bangkok (2 days) before we fly back. We'll be in Krabi Wednesday morning through Sunday mid-day and are staying near Tubkaek Beach on Krabi. 

We're mostly interested in seeing great views/landscapes, good food and learning about Thai culture. May spend a night or two exploring nightlife, but I'm getting older and hangovers are getting worse, so not planning to do too much partying. 

We're considering taking a trip to see the Khao Sok National Park while we're staying in Krabi. We'd be willing to pay for private transport so we don't have to spend as much time on a long bus ride. Would it be worth it to go to the park for a long day trip (i.e. leave first thing in the AM and arrive late at night)? Or do you really need to stay overnight 1 night to make the trip there worth it? 

Would appreciate any thoughts on the park itself as well! Thanks."

ThailandTourism,Phuket - airport transfer advice,"Hello all,

I recently spend just over a week in Phuket and while i had read about the taxi mafia on reddit, i didnt take any actions to avoid it once i got there.

I arrived at HKT airport late evening and came across the taxi stands which looked quite busy so i booked a taxi there, aware that i was probably going to be paying more than i should. I was going to Old Phuket Town which cost me 700THB. I was standing next to lady who was telling me how expensive her taxi was at 600THB though i cant recall where she was heading.

After waiting 20-30 minutes (i think), my taxi came and i was told to get into the taxi with another solo party who was heading to Patong, think he payed 800THB. I was a bit annoyed that I had to pay what seemed an expensive fair and also had to share a taxi with a stranger, who was not staying close to my hotel, though im not sure how normal this is being new to travel myself. Fortunately i was dropped off first but if i were the other party i would certainly be annoyed.

At the hotel the next day i decided i wanted a motorcycle to get around. I found a well reviewed store on google maps and took a Grab taxi there, 240THB 1.94KM. No bikes available so Grab back to the hotel and later that day Grab from my hotel in Phuket Town to Patong which cost 500THB.

I stayed at Rawai next and was told a taxi transfer back to airport would be 1000 THB. I ended up transferring back from Patong and i think the fair was 700THB.

I understand that there is an issue with Grab taxi's entering the airport for pickup/drop-off, and that drivers risk being fined if they do it.

My question is, what do you guys recommend or do when you travel to Phuket. Is it worth walking 1km away from the airport and booking Bolt or InDrive from there? How much THB are we talking about saving when doing so?

I will be going back to Phuket during rainy season so i dont want to hire a motorcycle if it is pouring with rain all day. I will need rely on taxi's or public transport to get around much more.

Sorry if this is a rant, just looking for some advice!

Thanks!"

ThailandTourism,Island Hopping Around Krabi/Phuket And Itinerary,"I'm flying into Krabi Thursday March 23rd and I plan on being in the area (Krabi, Phuket and the islands) until about Wednesday March 29th - Friday March 31st. I need to eventually end up in Penang, Malaysia by Tuesday April 4th to fly back home to the States and I'm looking for advice on my best option.

\- Option 1: I use Krabi as a home base, take various tours to different islands, skip Phuket, and take either a flight or a bus ride to Penang from Krabi. These transportation options give me the advantage of staying in one place. However, there are no direct flights to Penang. I would have a \~5.5 hour flight time with a layover in most likely Bangkok or I'd take a bus with about a \~7 hour travel time.

\- Option 2: I stay in Krabi for a certain amount of time, eventually make my way over to Phuket, and then take a nonstop flight to Penang with a travel time of only about an hour. I could either take a couple day tours to the islands while based out of Krabi, and then take a ferry directly from Krabi to Phuket. Or, I could leave Krabi one day, spend a couple overnights on various islands, and slowly make my way from Krabi to Phuket over the span of a couple days. The imagine my advantage with this option is I get to see Phuket, and my transportation time seems more efficient, although I'm not 100% on the logistics of this way.

A rough list of the islands I'm considering visiting (mostly between Krabi and Phuket):

\- Ko Poda

\- Koh Hong

\- Ko Yao Noi

\- Koh Yao Yai

\- Koh Khai Nok / Koh Khai Nai

\- Rang Yai Island

\- Maiton Island (south of Phuket)

\- Koh Hae (south of Phuket)

\- Koh Phi Phi (this seems to be the most popular island destination although it doesn't appear directly between Krabi and Phuket)

Any advice on what other travelers have done and their experience would help. Please give me specifics on what islands you'd recommend I visit, if it is worth going to Phuket, transportation tips for ferries and (to Penang) buses and flights, etc."
ThailandTourism,Where to go/stay in Koh Samui,"I’m traveling in thailand alone and I’ve been in Koh Samui for the past 2 days but I’m not sure where to go. I’m feeling a bit stuck because I am in a somewhat secluded area of the island right now (ban bang po) and I don’t want to rent a motorbike. 
Also a lot of places seem expensive and/or are already booked fully. I’m thinking of going to Chaweng to see what’s going on there, but I’m not sure what to expect and getting there will probably be quite expensive. I was hoping to get some tips on how to get around and where to stay especially as a solo traveler that doesn’t prefer to share a room."
ThailandTourism,I'd like to spend some time living in Thailand (18 years old),"Hello everybody. I'm from the UK and I'm 18 going on 19. I work from home and make a good living compared to most other people my age. For a month or two, I want to live somewhere intriguing and reasonably priced. I love to travel, and I've travelled to most of the European nations, but I've never been to Asia.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm therefore interested in spending a month living in Thailand (maybe 2 if it would be possible to get a visa extension). Although I haven't looked into it yet, I've been considering Airbnb and have heard that Agoda is a better alternative (haven't looked into this yet though). I also learned that Airbnb is prohibited for stays of less than 30 days, but I assume I'd be OK if I stayed for the full 30 days allowed by my visa?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm primarily just asking for general advice—where should I start? I'm looking for an apartment with decent wi-fi and a balcony and my ideal budget is £500 per month if I want to save money living in Thailand for a month or two instead of UK, however I could go higher if that is unrealistic. Though I'd prefer to stay in Bangkok, Pattaya appears to be the more affordable choice. Any guidance on this, once more, would be very appreciated.

Does this mean I can now return and have the remaining 17 days (45 minus 28 days)? Or does the day count reset when re-entering the country?

Is this what people are referring to when they mention 'border runs', where i assume exiting and re-entering the country resets the total days count? If this is the case, I understand immigration are within their rights to say you cannot re-enter, but if they do allow entry, do i get 45 days or 45 days minus the days i have stayed this year already. There would only be a few months between my visits and both are in the year 2023.

Appreciate any help and sorry if this is obvious, im new to travel."
ThailandTourism,Ferry in rainy weather conditions?,"Hello, I’m looking to book a ferry from Koh Phangan to Surat Thani in the upcoming week or so. Has anyone been on a ferry in the area in the past few days? How were the waves? I’m nervous and a little reluctant, because it’s been rainy, and there’s more rain in the forecast. I’ve also read horror stories of people throwing up and crying, thinking they’re going to die on ferries in bad conditions."
ThailandTourism,tuktuk scams in Bangkok ugh,"It's really annoying.   One said 50baht then when we arrived (1km) he insisted we agreed to 150baht.  

And later,  in downtown Bangkok, he brought us to a suit store insisting we had to go in for 5 minutes.

And most of the time they ask for 200baht for a short ride.  That's $10cdn and more than the taxi meter and grab rates...

We don't even want to ask anymore.  But it's the easiest way to get anywhere..."

ThailandTourism,"Where to go in Koh Samui… Fisherman’s Village, Koh Tao, then where?","My boyfriend and I are planning 10 days in/around Koh Samui. We love Fisherman’s Village (have been before) so will spend 4-5 days there, then a few days on Koh Tao. We have 3 days back in Koh Samui and I’m wondering where would be best to spend them. 

We are looking for somewhere relaxing in the day but with restaurants and bars in the evening (not bothered about clubbing). I am looking at Bangrak and Chaweng. Which would you recommend? Or somewhere else entirely?"
ThailandTourism,Thailand mid March,"First timers traveling for March birthdays (4 of us) trying to figure out itinerary. Current plan: fly into Bkk stay 3 days then travel to Koh Tao to get PADI certified 3-4 days. After that we’re stuck between going to Chiang Mai for the elephants, going to another island or just heading back to Bangkok since we fly home from there. Suggestions? Will be there 12 full days. 

We like beaches, don’t care about hiking, some night markets would be great and street food. 

Also, should we be concerned with flying after scuba diving?? Thanks in advance!!"
ThailandTourism,What do you think this sound is? Heard in Phuket national park. Kinda sounded like some kind of bird.,
ThailandTourism,does anyone know what this is? it's found on some scooters but not all and I keep wondering what it is.,
ThailandTourism,Ethical elephants?,"Visiting Phuket and staying at JW Marriott, which shuttles us to their properties around here. At one property called Turtle Village, which seems to be sponsored or owned by MVC there were two elephants on display and chained, where people can touch and feed them. I know Thailand is battling ethical treatment of elephants as it is but their [website](https://www.marriottvacationclub.com.au/vacation-resorts/marriott-mai-khao-beach/activities.shtml) specifically states you can ride elephants as part of their programs offered. Everything I’ve read says elephants aren’t built to carry humans and it is unethical to ride them. My question is how can Marriott or MVC (which I know isn’t officially owned by Marriott but is using their marks) endorse this? I’m sure Thailand isn’t the only country where they’re exploiting unethical treatment of animals for tourism. Just curious if anyone else has encountered something similar or no."
ThailandTourism,Recommendation for condo or rental house.,"Hey everyone, I have a fiancé in Bangkok and we definitely want to move into a bigger space. I don’t live in Thailand but will have to go back and forward just dude the nature of it sucking being away for so long from my partner. 

Where do you all look for more upscale nicer condos. Do you have any sites you prefer using for this? 

I’m thinking of the 18to 20k baht range"
ThailandTourism,Phuket recommendation,"Hello all, I plan on going to Phuket in April or early may. I was wondering what hotels you would recommend. I want something a bit more high end and relaxing. I’m more about the massage, and enjoying the beach. Love night life as well on some nights.  I plan on staying for maybe 4 days so nothing too long. New resorts would be cool as well."

ThailandTourism,does anyone know what this is? it's found on some scooters but not all and I keep wondering what it is.,
ThailandTourism,What's the best way to explore islands in Krabi?,"In April I'll have 12 days to explore islands in Krabi.
In your opinion, is it better to stay in one place as my base, for example Ao Nang and go for day trips from there or stay for a few days at Ao Nang and then move to stay in Koh Lanta as a base and go to other islands from there? 


Islands I'm planning to visit are Lanta, Ngai, Muk, Phi Phi and maybe some more if convenient."
ThailandTourism,What the hell is wrong with people in Pai? Experienced nothing but rude nasty tourists since I got here,"I swear it is not me. Literally just now I experienced a European couple get very aggressive and nasty towards a street food vendor over a Tuna pastry which cost a mere 10 baht. They snapped they were given the wrong one and then demanded a free tuna one. They took it and walked off without paying.

Left the poor lady in tears so I slipped her a 20 and said don't worry about it. Then just yesterday another rude asshole demanding NO EGG IN MY PAD THAI GOT IT?! Don't even get me started on the people in the bars. Seriously what is up with this place? Is it just instant asshole mode as soon as they reach Pai? Never experienced anything else like it elsewhere in Thailand. 

And sure ok maybe I'm overreacting but Jesus, it's seriously put me off this place. I've just found people here to be very standoffish I guess? Just a wind of bad luck perhaps? Who knows, but honestly some of the stuff I've witnessed here is just beyond belief and they sure as hell wouldn't behave like they do here in their home country. Heard similar stories with Phuket but I didn't really see anything there. 

Anyone else experienced this somewhere in Thailand?"
ThailandTourism,"Do girls have private WhatsApp groups where they share info on the ""farangers"" they are meeting?","I'm pretty sure I read this on a previous Reddit thread in this sub. That girls will share screenshot of the guys they are meeting... to make sure they are not two timing.

I have been texting a girl who I was on 1 date with. Last week I was hoping to meet her again but she was being evasive and kept changing the conversation... naturally I went back on Tinder and arranged a date with another girl. I'm travelling alone for 7/8 weeks. The previous girl is still texting me with interest, despite her evasiveness in the previous weekend. 

So here I am tonight sipping cocktails on Chaweng beach in Samui, looking forward to meeting this new girl.

When out of nowhere the previous girl texts me ""Hi, are you in a hotel in Chaweng?""

Chaweng is in Koh Samui and this girl lives in a different part - furthermore, she can't really move at the moment due to an accident on her motorbike.

When I asked her how she knew, she was being very evasive in her response. Sending wink emojis and so on.

As it happened, around the same time I had received the text I had literally confirmed with tonight's date which hotel I am in.

Neither of these girls are freelance or ladyboys, they all work full time.... but the series of events indicates some small island collaboration about which farangers girls are seeing who may also be seeing other people.  I say ""seeing"" very loosely here as neither of these engagements can be considered committal in any sense, thus far.

Curious if I'm talking out of my arse, but pretty sure I saw something similar on this sub before."

ThailandTourism,Visa Extension,"I know this has likely been asked many times but I trust Reddit to provide right away :)

I’m in Chiang Rai now just to see some temples. My 45 day visa exemption ends March 1st. I don’t really feel like taking the slow boat to Laos. I want to go back towards Chiang Mai and head straight south to Krabi &amp; Koh Lanta. 

Can I just pay the 1.900 Bhat for the 90 day extension and when that ends fly out of Thailand to say Cambodia and get another 30 day extension upon return? Or do I need to get the 30 days first and then pay for 90 days. Thanks everyone"

ThailandTourism,"Patong, Kata Beach or Karon Beach or other suggestions?","I (30f) am going Thailand with my mum and her partner this year. I’ve been previously about 4 times in my early twenties and travelled around but it has been a while so seeking advise/thoughts on the Phuket area. 

We are probably going to be in the Phuket area for around 3/4 nights before moving on to the islands and I am not sure where to stay when we arrive. I have heard Karon and Kata are nice places but are they much different to Patong? 

I’ve only ever stayed in hostels and guest houses in Phuket town and Patong and only for a night or two, so with that and the fact I am no longer a backpacker, it’s probably going to be a pretty different trip. 

We would be looking to go to the beach, markets, restaurants, day trips, mostly a relaxing holiday but we do enjoy a drink as well. 

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!"

My significant other and I are having a fantastic time in Thailand and should like to immerse ourselves in the culture a bit and extend our stay if possible. If you have any suggestions/advice for the following please let me know!!

I am namely interested in training in Muay Thai, or going to a culinary school. I would also go to a language school if I can't get into a MT or cooking school for some reason.

Additionall, I for a while if the opportunity becomes available. In the USA I work as a Beverage/Bar Consultant and Bartender. I know bar work here will not get you a visa unless it is managerial in nature, which I would also be happy to explore. Let me know if I have anything wrong so far.

My significant other would like to volunteer with an animal/dog rescue and rehabilitation center.

We have entered thailand 2 times now for about 80 days total using visa on arrival. 

Mostly I am curious what your experience with getting a visa is for any of the following and the process you went through to get it. If you have a school/volunteer organization you know or have used please let me know

ThailandTourism,Good Condo in bangkok for a month - possible?,"Hello everyone. I'm planning to got to Thailand towards the end of March, and I was thinking on sticking around Bangkok (my arrival airport) for maybe a month.

I did see quite a few videos on the subject and read a couple of things about it. My takeaway is that the usual good condos (not hotels) are not really available to tourists. They are always on 1+ year contracts, and subletting them into AirBnB's is apparently something the managing companies try hard to avoid.


But, I did see that people sometimes sublet their apartments. Say an expat who's off to his home country for a few months.


Now, my question to you is: Given that I have no ties with Bangkok (noone I know is there right now), is it reasonable for me to even try to find such a place for a month? Is there maybe a site/subreddit that would help?"
ThailandTourism,Phuket bar scam- don’t play games with the bartender,"Bartender in Patong walking street started off cool, served me my buy-one-get-one drinks, held onto the change to my 1000bt, and then grabbed a Connect 4 game and suggested we play together. I told him I’ll just play with the girl I’ve been traveling with but he insisted we play against each other. He proceeded to grab 3 shot glasses and proposed that the winner of the game buys shots. I figured why not. I lost. Twice. He then shows me a bill for 1900bt aside from what I already bought. Now having realized I got played like an idiot, I angrily told him to buy himself one shot with my change and return the rest. He says it’s okay and that I can just pay 900, but I still refuse and ask for my change. He comes back with 60bt change and pours a shot of garbage and offered it to me. I, clearly frustrated, look at his fellow bartender who seems to know what is happening and suddenly she pulls 350bt from her pocket and hands it to me. 

Patong is a the biggest tourist trap I’ve ever been to."
ThailandTourism,How should I spend a month in Thailand?,"I am going to be going to Thailand from mid-May to mid-June with a friend after we graduate university. 

We are both fairly adventurous, open-minded, and genuinely interested in the culture, people, history, food etc. We definitely value being able to wander around, explore places, and observe what local life is like. We are also excited to see the natural beauty of the land too!

While I’m not strictly against going out/partying, it’s not something I have a huge interest in.

Because of this, I was thinking of staying in around 3 locations. I don’t want to be pressured to have to pack many things in or waste too much time traveling (while I am excited to take the train)

So far we are definitely going to Chiang Mai and Bangkok. However, we are a bit conflicted on what to do outside of the two. 

Since Bangkok and Chiang Mai are both cities, it could be nice to have the third location be a bit different.

My friend mentioned Pai. I’m sure we would have a great time, but without sounding pretentious, I’m not sure if we would be getting as much of an authentic experience there (lmk if I am wrong). 

I was interested in Chiang Rai, Khon Kaen, Nan, and Loei.

What are your thoughts? Any recommendations?"

Does anyone have experiences with a company that they can vouch for, e.g for any hospital treatment, lost belongings, cancellations, etc. What kind of price should we be expected to pay for this length stay?

When checking the reviews it's hard to gage whether a company is trustworthy or not, because of the loopholes that typically trip people up when it comes to insurance, leading to a lot of angry reviews.

Something that concerns me is some companies stating they don't cover private medical care. I'd imagined that most good medical care would be private when travelling SEA, and don't want insurance that doesn't cover that. I could be wrong though, so any advice is very appreciated, thanks."

ThailandTourism,Currency Exchange &amp; Sim Card,"Hi folks. I'm coming to Thailand next week for 6 days. I would like to ask is it okay if I carry Indian Rupees with me and exchange those for Thai Bhats or do I get a better exchange rate if I convert my currency to US Dollars. Some countries have a preference for particular currency and you don't get good rates for other currencies.

Also, which brand of sim card is good for one week use? I don't need calling minutes, just data. The more the better."

ThailandTourism,Looking for recommendations and advice on Phuket,"Hi, thanks for clicking on my post.

We are three guys in our mid to late 20s traveling to Phuket for 3 nights and 2 days at the end of this month. We are not looking for sex tourism. I was hoping to get some recommendations such as

Where should we set up base which are nice and not overly touristy (some is fine) to minimise local travel? So far we booked a hostel called Lub D in patong since our first night we land at 8 and figured it'll be better to be close to the main area so that we don't waste more time traveling.

Cost of local travel and best way to do it need be?

Which beaches would you recommend which are laid back that have some good food or beach front clubs?

What are some chill bars to lounge in? What do drinks generally cost at a bar?

Any banging nightclubs we should visit? What's the entry scene plus what would be the cost of drinks?

Some good restaurants? If you can please include approximate costs as well.

Haven't seen much online about the eastern side is this something we should consider covering?

If you had to pick one island to visit for a day trip which one? How do we travel to and what would be the cost? Without a guided tour if possible. If you know of ferry or speed boat schedules that would be super helpful!

What tourist traps should we avoid/look out for?

Any questions that you can provide answers for would greatly appreciated. Thank you for reading it all. Hope to get some good ideas from the lovely people on this for how to best spend our time in Phuket. Cheers!"

ThailandTourism,Russian turist on Phuket,"
 So that was my 4 vacation in Phuket, and probably never again.
You no longer have the feeling that you are in Thailand, Phuket has become a small Russia.
But the worst thing is that really Russian tourists are the worst.
They get drunk day and night, are terribly behavior, aggressive and do not care about anyone around them. It is impossible to be with them in the same hotel, beach or street, they do not respect anyone or anything.
Come on, it would be less noticeable if the Thais stick to their rules and culture as we thought. They have changed a lot in just one year. They let the Russians do whatever they want for money. They humiliate them and disrupt their concept of everything they are, and they accept it all for money. They are stupid and thay will become slaves to Russians very soon!"

ThailandTourism,Chiang Mai and Koh Samui in June,"Hi everyone, with a group of friends we were planning to come (for our first time) to Thailand, but our only availabilities would be mid/late June.
 
We went to a travel agency that proposed Chiang Mai, but I read that rainy season in the north starts earlier. How doable would be to go to the north in June?

The travel agency also suggested koh Samui, and being more to the south, I think the rain would not be there completely. Is it advisable to go to an island during rainy season?

ThailandTourism,"Surat Thani sees sharp rise in arrivals, revenue",
ThailandTourism,Chiang Mai or No?,"My partner and I are visiting Thailand and we are working on our itinerary. Our current plan is:

4 days Bangkok
4-5 days island hopping
3-4 days Phuket

We are debating if we should also visit Chiang Mai for 2 days, the dilemma being that it is the opposite direction of the other locations and would cut in to island/Phuket time. 

Is Chiang Mai worth cutting in to our other plans? If so, what are some favorite things to do in and around the area?

We are both very active and enjoy hiking, food, mountains, and experiencing the culture of a place. Doi Inthanon was the main recommendation we had received previously, but it looks like a lot of driving and less hiking/being in nature/ looking at pretty things. 

Thanks in advance for any advice!"

ThailandTourism,Traffic after Songkran,"I will be landing in Bangkok on the 16th of April and have 4 days before heading to Phuket (20th - 27th) and then 3 more days before heading home.


My initial plan was to vist Bangkok surronding areas during the first 4 days (Ayutthaya, Erawan National Park, Khao Yai National Park) and visit Bangkok proper once back from Phuket.


However I just realised that I will land just after Songkran end and I read a lot of horror stories of bumper to bumper traffic during that period. So I've been wondering:


* Will the traffic still be bad from the 16th to the 20th?
* Should I reconsider and do Bangkok first since the city will be very quiet? or will a lot of places close during that period?
* Lastly slightly off topic but on the 16th I will land at 6am after a 12 hour flight... any tips on something relatively relaxing to do on the first day?"

Its strange going to a hotel and not being able to sleep because of overly loud banging doors for example all nigth everyone does it, that means NO ONE can sleep they bang in tegh day etc , I dotn care really so much but its WEIRD because then no one can sleep, it makes no sense at all it seems liek everyone is liek i was as a teenager

Anywhere else everyone is careful nto to wake each otehrr up its reasonable cause then everyone sleeps well, is that ""high class"" behaviour ie more rare behaviour that ud get in higher money areas in more wealthy countries, and this is ""rough"" or normal behaviour for most places in the world?"

Both have said there aren't any faster options other than traveling the whole way by land from **Krabi airport to Koh Lanta**. Also, they said the only way from **Koh Lanta to Railay,** other than the once-per-day ferry, is to use their longtail boat service which takes 3 hours and is much more expensive than the ferry? Are the speedboat options no longer available? It's very difficult to find any solid info online."

ThailandTourism,7 day Bangkok itinerary review &amp; help with the onward journey!,"I will be going to Thailand(solo for the first time) in March for 2 weeks. I will also be working remotely for a few days and so I will not be free on all mornings. I wanted to stay at hostels for a few days but I couldn't find any hostel with private rooms(if you know of any then please let me know). I have come up with the following things to do in Bkk:-

* 18th march - Reach Bangkok in the afternoon. Go straight to the hotel to check-in. Head out to a currency exchange to get Baht. Come back to the hotel and sleep. In the evening, roam around and get a relaxing massage as a cure for the hectic travelling. Thailand is just a 3.5 hour flight from here but I would have been awake the entire previous night. After that, maybe roam around the bars in Sukhumvit area and find someone to have drinks with.
* 19th - March - No plans as such. I might meet up with a fellow traveller but not sure. If not then again roam around the streets or maybe go to the central mall.
* 20th March - Visit Ayutthaya - full day tour. Come back to the hotel, relax a bit and then again head out in the evening/night to Soi Cowboy to explore [https://www.thrillophilia.com/tours/ayutthaya-day-tour](https://www.thrillophilia.com/tours/ayutthaya-day-tour).
* 21st March - The grand palace tour ( from [https://www.thrillophilia.com/tours/ayutthaya-day-tour](https://www.thrillophilia.com/tours/ayutthaya-day-tour)). its a 2 hour tour and starts off very early in the morning. For the remaining part of the day, I'll be working. Then I will again head out at night to roam around / massage
* 22nd March - Floating market tour (6 hours). Come back after lunch, take a nap and again head out to roam around/clubs. [https://www.thrillophilia.com/tours/thailand-floating-market-day-trip](https://www.thrillophilia.com/tours/thailand-floating-market-day-trip)
* 23rd March - Work in the morning. At night, roam around Nana, Sukhumvit or Soi cowboy whatever felt the best. 
* 24th March - Checkout at 12PM and leave for Pattaya.

I don't have any plans for the nights other than roam around and see where the night takes me. Not sure if its a good idea or not but I couldn't find anything specific as such.

As you can see, I am thinking of booking **tours** for grand palance, Ayutthaya &amp; floating market. The reason is that I will be with other people and I won't have to make any arrangements to and from these places. Can someone please suggest if the prices look appropriate or if someone can share their experience with this website? 

Now after Bangkok, I have no itienary for Pattaya :/ . I know about the Walking Street but that opens up at night. No idea about the mornings. I am very flexible with the itienary as of now. I am also open to reduce the duration by a few days either in Bangkok or Pattaya for a **3rd city** as long as it has good **social atmosphere**(first time solo, so don't want to get bored) and is not very far off or hard to reach at. Oh and yes, I will be working for 2 days in between 25th March-1st April, so won't have 2 mornings free. 

Please do share any suggestions."

ThailandTourism,"Help with travel itinerary, Bangkok, April","So, my sister and her friends (all girls) are planning to revisit Bangkok this April, and need help with planning. 
- Places she already visited last time: Muang Boran, Ayutthaya, places around The Grand Palace, Chocolate Ville, Asiatique The Riverfront, and some night markets near Pratunam and Rangnam (where they stayed, and intend to stay again this time)
- They do not like partying and walking in particular, while prefer shopping for cheap stuffs and taking picture

With that being said, the current plan is as follow:
- 22/04: After arriving at the hotel in late afternoon, travel to IconSiam for eating, shopping, and sight-seeing in general
- 23/04: Wat Saket in the morning, Wat Kamala, Yi Kor Hong Shrine, Sun Wukong Shrine, and maybe Wat Traimit in the afternoon, then Chinatown for the night
- 24/04: No particular ideas now, open to suggestions
- 25/04: Wat Paknam Bhasicharoen and some other temple near there (any suggestion?) for the morning, Centralworld and around there for the afternoon (mainly shopping), then BigC for the night (more shopping, since the shopping center would mostly be closed by then?) 
- 26/04: Last minute shopping, then pack up and move to go home

In addition, I would also appreciate suggestions on places to eat. Per my sister, last time around they mostly survived on Bonchon and 7-11 meals (lol), while You&amp;I Hotpot ended up not very satisfying (spicy soup + sweet tea = very upset stomach).

ThailandTourism,Can you rent a motorbike with only an International Driver's License?,"I'm from the US, and when I went to renew my license before I left, there were some issues which meant I didn't get my new license in time. It arrived after I left, so I have access to the number and expiration and everything. If I use that to get an international driver's license, can I use that? Or would I also need to have my US license on me in case I got pulled over?

Last year, I was pulled over by police in Chiang Mai who told me for one reason or another I had to pay them 500 baht, which I understand is just kind of how it works here. Would the international driver's license suffice?"

ThailandTourism,Thailand Immigration Officer at Swampy had the nerve to do this to me!!!,"My flight left the US and hour and a half late and then ran into a 150kt jet stream and lost another hour plus I was sitting next to Chatty Cathy, the therapist, and her new BF, a doctor. So, that's 16 hours for what should be 12. Then, I've got 40 minutes to make my connection, which I did because that flight was running late, too. Luckily the medicos were heading to Hanoi (amazing what you learn when they just. don't. shut. up.) so I didn't have to play that again. Then I got to arrivals at Suvarnabhumi. The line started at the bottom of the ramp. In over ten years - including in 2019 - I have never seen it that crowded. 

Forty-five minutes later I'm standing in front of the aforementioned Immigration agent - who has been at this for god knows how many hours already - getting printed and photo'd. Then he sits there thumbing through my passport. He goes: ""You come to Thailand a lot."" Turns another page. ""Yeah,"" he says, ""a real Thailand guy."" \*STAMP\* ""Welcome home.""

And THAT is why Thailand is the best freaking country in the world."

ThailandTourism,Great destinations?,"Hi all!

I have been traveling SEA [mostly Thailand] for the last 3 months and am having a fantastic time. 

I have spent about 45 days staying all over different districts in Bangkok and it has been delightful. Additionally I spent a week in Chiang Mai (possibly my favorite stay thus far] and am currently in Hua Hin unwinding and spending some time reading and doing nothing.

I am curious where you might suggest visiting outside of Bangkok, Phuket, and Chiang Mai/Rai?

My main interests are cooking/eating, markets, cannabis, and beaches/nature

On my list I have:
Ayutthaya
Koh Lanta
Koh Larn
Koh Samui
Bang Saen Beach
Chiang Mai [revisit North outside of burning szn]

If you have any specific hotel/dining/cannabis reccomendactions those are all super appreciated. I also really enjoy traveling via the railway so extra points to suggestions near stations!

If you coincidentally have any questions/need reccomenations about Bangkok, Chiang Mai, or Hua Hin I am happy to give my input as I am keeping a catalog of good experiences locations and destinations.

Thanks so much for any advice! Additionally a special thank you to the Thai people for having me and being so warm and welcoming 🙏🏻"

I will try to sit sideways so that my feet do not point directly at them, but I really want to make an effort to show as much respect as I can - within my current physical limitations.

Bangkok - 3 days

I asked a couple people on another forum about my trip plans for 2 weeks and they told me it seemed like too much traveling for my time frame. So I'm actually going to be there for 17 days instead. Can I get everyones opinion if this is doable or do you think its too much traveling? Personally I would like to see all these places.  

I plan to arrive in bangkok and initially spend 3 days there

Then I will do a direct 1 hour flight to chiang mang and spend 4 days there

From chiang mang will do direct 1.5 hour flight to Krabi and stay there for 3 days 

From Krabi take 2.5 hour Pherry to Phuket and stay 2 more days since they are close by

Then from Phucket Ill do a direct flight to Pattaya and spend 3 days there then take taxi to airport on the morning I leave home (1.5 hours tax ride).

So in total for a 17 days trip I am doing 3 flights that will take half a day each give or take a little and then the tax and ferry which are only a couple hours each. 

What are your thoughts? And if you had to take out one place from the list which would it be?"

I hope you can help me and give me some advice.

I am male in twenties from Europe and I am planning on visiting Thailand/SE Asia next month for duration of 3 weeks all by myself. I am not strictly on budget, but I wouldn't like to spend more than I need to.

I was thinking about the following itinerary:

1. 4 nights in Bangkok
2. 4 nights in Chiang Mai
3. 3 nights in Siem Reap (Cambodia)
4. 7 nights in Phuket
5. 2 nights in Bangkok

I am arriving and departing from Bangkok so that is why I'll be going there twice.

I wonder what you think about it and if perhaps I should change something. Also, I am required to have a visa for entry in Thailand, and since I am planning on going to Cambodia and then returning to Thailand, one-time entry visa obviously won't be enough for me. I read about re-entry permits that can be requested at the airports in Thailand and I am just wondering if that's going to do the trick?

ThailandTourism,Why are Thai people so rude towards me?,"Is it because I don't speak the language?

Told a ladyboy she is very pretty but I am sorry that I am not into lady boys, only to be threatened again. I'm on someone elses land so I've always made an effort to be extra polite and respectful, always greet people with a smile and say thank you in Thai. But I am starting to think my politeness is causing me to be treated like a doormat.

The last straw was the 711 lady literally waving her hand in my face and telling me to go away because I politely asked her where they kept some food. If this was back in my home country I would of told them to fuck off. But I don't know how that'd go down here."

ThailandTourism,Another post looking for an advice on a two-week itinerary,"  

Dear experienced travellers, I need your help planning a two-week trip to Thailand.

I will be in Thailand in April for two weeks+ and have a general itinerary planned. Before booking any accommodations or anything else, I wanted to hear your thoughts on the itinerary. I'm worried that my plan is too extensive and unrealistic, and that I'll wind up spending too much time getting from point A to point B and vice versa. So it would be great to hear your opinion. 

We were also considering shortening our stay in Krabi and instead traveling to Koh Samui, and then from Koh Samui to Bangkok. Do you think that it's a good/realistic idea?

For context, I'll be traveling with two other friends, and all three of us are pretty flexible and willing to try anything. The only exception is that we are not planning on taking any part in animal tourism (e.g., animal sanctuaries).

I then came back on a tourist visa (after a brief stint in the UK) which I changed over to a Muay Thai Education visa that runs out in May.

I now live with my Thai girlfriend too and plan to continue living with her.

I was sustaining myself remotely for this time, doing audio editing but unfortunately, I lost my main client and I'm suffering quite a lot financially because of it.

I've got some savings (400k baht).

So my questions are...

* Should/can I renew my Muay Thai visa for another 6 months after coming back on another Tourist visa? the school hasn't been too responsive. I could just chance using savings until I find more work remotely
* Is buying the online Tefl course and teaching the better option? I don't have any teaching experience but I do have a bachelor's degree. I have heard lots of mixed opinions about this
* The pipedream would be landing an audio job in Bangkok and they take care of the visa process but I know this is infinitely unlikely to happen

Any advice is welcome..."
ThailandTourism,Getting Back from 4-Island Tour from Phucket," 

So it seems as though all the online charter companies have their final boat coming back from Phi Phi BEFORE sunset. but the Sunset tours end at 930pm. We're trying to get back to our Phuket hotel by 11pm.

Basically, we're looking to find a boat back from PhiPhi to Phuket after 930 but before 1030? It doesn't seem like anything online is doing it. Am I missing soemthing? Does anybody have any suggestions?

Our current plan is to just kind of wing it and hope we can find a private boat home or something. Thoughts?"

I have no clue how the artists call themselves, anybody into that kind of music and has a playlist /recommendations for me?

I'm talking mostly about the uplifting, energetic, good mood, drinking, rock / pop songs. Some Thai bands performed such music also live in some of the more touristy places. Not much into the slow love songs tbh.

Any help is greatly appreciated! Stay healthy, enjoy your holidays in TH and fan dee kup. ;)"

ThailandTourism,3-4 week travel advice!,"Hey all, my partner and I are planning to go for 3-4 weeks in late June, just have a few general questions as I'm not an experienced traveller, so please tell me if any of this sounds stupid or unrealistic!  


**budget &amp; length -** the plan right now is to go for around 3 to 4 weeks with a budget of around £1000 to £1500 (40-65k baht?) each, not including flights. we aren't interested in very touristy things or expensive partying etc, more centred around cool activities and accommodation, landmarks and culture, nature reserves etc. my thinking was also to spend the first couple of weeks staying at cheaper accommodation and then ending the trip somewhere a bit fancier for the last few days.

&amp;#x200B;

**route -** we'd like to travel around and see different parts of the country, so right now the thinking is start off in chiang mai and end the journey in phuket, or vice versa. any advice on the route or things to see/places to stay along the way, or would you maybe pick different start/end destinations?

&amp;#x200B;

**useful apps/getting around -** any useful apps to do with travel (or ones to avoid), taxis, finding places to eat or stay, etc., or general tips for travelling via public transport

&amp;#x200B;

**flights, one way or return, best airlines -** if the plan is to start at one end of the country and finish at the other end, would it make more sense to book separate one-way flights? it seems like it might be a bit cheaper to get a return to and from bangkok, but at the expense of travel costs going north, coming back down south, and then back to bangkok, which just seems like a worse idea

&amp;#x200B;

**phone sim, data, currency -** any specific advice on phones and SIM cards etc, do i need to buy another one while there? i've also seen advice on not bringing currency, but instead finding an ATM when you land and getting money out that way. how much do you usually carry around/do most places have contactless?

&amp;#x200B;

thanks for reading, any advice at all will be super useful!"

ThailandTourism,Best cheap way to see Cambodia (on way to Vietnam from BKK)?,"On the way to Vietnam from Bangkok, is there a cheap (affordable) way to stop in and see Angkor Wat on the way? Not a must but would also like to stop in PP if it's not too much more as well.

Doing it all by airplane seems quite expensive. (Flying direct to HCMC would be C$65 while going through SR/AW and PP would be: BKK -&gt; SR C$90, SR -&gt; PP C$160, PP -&gt; HCMC C$120 for a total of C$370 at a minimum just for transportation. Add in another C$85 for AW entrance fee, and now we're looking at an additional $450 each at least. Would love to see it but it eats up a lot of my budget. I could save a bit by skipping Phnom Penh, I guess but it's still a lot for 3 days when that much would pay for a month's hotel in many places.

I've read other threads mentioning cheap buses but most replies say it's dangerous bc of the maniac drivers and a shitshow at the border, scams, etc. Doesn't seem like the little bit saved would be worthwhile.

I also saw an old thread about someone taking a train bkk-sr for literally 40 THB, but when I searched, I couldn't find any trains at all from bkk-sr.

Now that I'm here on the 45 day exempt entry, will a TM30 situation be necessary at the immigration office when I go to extend?

I hop around and stay at different residences in the Chonburi area.

ThailandTourism,How do Farangs use Shopee?,"I apologize in advance because I know this is likely one of those posts that will get a lot of ""Google it"" and ""search the sub"" comments but I've done both and I can't figure it out. 

I had no problem getting set up on Lazada. When I first arrived I bought things with my US credit card and had them shipped to me with no problem (this was before I had a Thai bank account or an official Thai address). Now I use my Bangkok Bank card on Lazada with no problem. 

But Shopee has been impossible for me. I tried early on with my US card and it didn't work. Since Lazada did work I forgot about Shopee for awhile. Fast forward: now that I have a registered address and a Thai bank account I'd like to access Shopee too. 

I have a Shopee account but when I try to enter my payment information it doesn't work. The only choices I have are enter card info or enter bank info. My Bangkok Bank card gets rejected and the bank option requires an IC number (Thai ID # I obviously don't have).

TIA for any help/tips anyone can offer. 

PS: I'm using the website on desktop. The app I was able to download (IOS) is only in Thai. If there's a way to switch to English I can't find it. If I have to use the app I guess I can have a Thai friend help me get signed in but I'd much rather use the website which I can translate into English."

I normally live in North thailand and to escape the pollution I'm on a 7 day trip to Krabi.

It's a gorgeous place but in these past days I have seen some utterly horrendous behaviour.

Indians comming too late for every tour and even in the tour they let the rest of the group wait even though the guide specifically said not to come to late and meet back at the boat on the appointed time.

3 older Russians taking objects from the Princess Cave shrine to inspect and then put back or leave on the ground. 

Young Western girls wearing g strings next to a temple or mosque.

Groups of loud young Israelis being loud and obnoxious shouting in their own language at each and every person they see and seemingly making fun of them.

Westerners being rude to thai people and looking at them like they are idiots for not being able to speak fluent English. 

Okay I will stop here, but it baffles my mind the disrespect and rudeness of people to their fellow humans.

The local thais so far have been nothing but nice to me (especially after they find out I speak intermediate thai).

We will probably want to go to a restaurant/bar to hang out at night but don't want anything crazy.

Wanting to have accommodation for the whole time at one resort, but are interested in doing a night at Phi Phi Islands - is this doable? Again, nothing is booked yet so any advice is welcome.

What part of Phuket should we book our main accommodation for? And what kind of activities can we book in Phuket that are easy to get to?

**General travelling questions**

What is the recommended money situation? Do we bring anything before we arrive or are Wise cards still the go to? We are coming from Australia.

What is your recommended eSIM carrier? We won't need calling minutes, just a decent/unlimited amount of data.

What's the best way of getting around Bangkok and Phuket? How about to and from both airports?

I booked two separate tickets and their system somehow processed my name incorrectly, placing my Family Name as my First Name and Family Name. (so my ticket shows as ""FAMILY, MIDDLE FAMILY""

All of this is after -- searching for flights on a particular date shows no results until I switch to a different day, then back to the day I want. More than 10 attempts to process payment before the website would actually process the payment.

I reached out to customer support via email with a photo of my passport and explained the issue, and they're saying it doesn't fall within the conditions to edit my name on my ticket.

I'm not sure what to do at this point. I'm not buying another ticket because it's clear that the website will just process it incorrectly again. It doesn't look like other airlines are flying at the times that I need.

We are landing in Bangkok, from there we are trying to decide where to go. 

Our plan is to land in Bangkok on the 28th

The choice in front of us is to go to Koh Chang or Phuket.

We either spend the day in Bangkok and take an overnight taxi to Trat and take the ferry to Koh Chang and spend 2 nights there. (Are overnight taxis a thing?)

Or fly out to Phuket the same day. And spend 3 nights there.

We planned this under the assumption of spending the weekend in Bangkok, since we figured it would be most lively during the weekend, while these other two places might not see as big a dip in popularity on weekdays. 

How correct is the assumption to begin with?

Which place out of Phuket and Koh Chang would be more suitable for our needs? 

How stark would the difference in both places be? 

Would we find a decent number of people and party places in Koh Chang?

Please keep in mind it's the weekdays, Tues, Wed, Thurs if we go to Phuket.

Wed, Thurs if we go to Koh Chang.

ThailandTourism,Best scooter rental?,"Hi! My gf and I are going to Thailand (first time for me, second time for her) in March. We were researching scooter rentals and there seems to be a wide array of prices. I was wondering if anyone here might have some tips about where is best to rent? We’ll be in Bangkok, Chang Mai, and then the island areas like Kho Sumai (we haven’t fully decided about the islands yet). Any tips would be greatly appreciated."
ThailandTourism,Solotraveler in Khao Lak - recommendations or anyone want to meet?,"Just arrived in Khao Lak and it seems quite like a family/couples destination. A lot of tours are overcharging ridiculously if you are alone it seems, though I have trips to Similan and Khao Sok planned. My hostel also seems to be quite empty.

Has anyone a good idea what to do here on my own (was at the beach and at the market today) or anyone want to do anything together like bamboo rafting or Little Amazon or waterfalls?

Unfortunately I can't rent/drive a scooter, but I don't mind walking a lot or even hiking."
ThailandTourism,Bangkok day trip to dragon temple + Amphawa Floating Market,"I am planning a trip where I will be staying in Bangna area in Bangkok and it sounds interesting to do a Saturday day trip to Wat Samphran/dragon temple and then Amphawa Floating Market. 


It will be expensive in a Bolt/taxi, but I am not sure of any public transit options and if they are, it may add on a lot of delay? So I am considering going early in the day to Wat Samphran, then taxi to Amphawa Floating Market. I saw on google maps that people like to do firefly boat tour there at 9-10pm. 


Is this worth doing? I am not sure of the timing, but if I plan to see that firefly tour and then get a Bolt back to Bangna, it would be close to midnight by then.


Does this sound like a decent idea?"

ThailandTourism,Phuket advice please,I need some help with deciding where to book in Phuket and what type of accommodation. I will be visiting with my two daughters 8 and 12 years for 8 nights. We would like 4 or 5 star kid friendly accommodation that is on or close to a quiet beach with no big waves and not a lot of people approaching us selling things. We would spend many hours each day in the pool so we’d like one with lots of lush shady gardens around it. Because I’m with my young children I’d like to be able to walk close by to get food at night that isn’t going to pass by seedy night clubs or bars.  Thanks in advance for your recommendations.

I'm very keen to try some southern food. Is there good grilled seafood on the beach? I've seen yellow rice and chicken alot, but wondering what else to try?

Anywhere good to chill while the kids have distractions or the beach to play are  good.

Is it worth taking them to the lake? I didn't bring their swimming bands as they were too bulky.

Also, where can I get buckets and spades?"

ThailandTourism,First solo trip - Hostel/Hotel suggestions,"After being forever scared of solo trips, I have finally decided to pull the trigger. I will be visiting Thailand for the 2nd time in March(Bangkok &amp; Pattaya for 2 weeks). I will be staying at both hotels &amp; hostels. Hotels are easier to find but the challenge is with the hostels since I have never ever stayed at one. For hostels, I prefer  private rooms. I will also be working for a few days remotely. I am planning to split my stay as follows:-

* Bangkok (prefer the Sukhumvit area. I've also heard that Khao San is way too loud and overcrowded)
   * 3 days - Hostel
   * 3 days - Hotel
* Pattaya
   * 2 days - Hostel
   * 5 days - Hotel.

My hostel preferences are a good social enviornment to interact with people. It doesn't has to be a party scene all night but just to meet a few people and maybe hangout with them sometime, 

For Bangkok, I found a few suggestions for the hostels - Bodega, Here and Hom hostel but the issue with them are that they don't have any private rooms with washrooms attached. 

For Pattaya, I found Happy hostel but its reviews say that its more of a hotel in terms of socialising. 

Also, I read at some places to avoid Pattaya as a solo traveller but I didn't understand why. Other than the city being filled with old guys looking for sex and a lot of freelancers(which is fine by me), is there anything else wrong with it that makes it any worse to travel as a ""solo"" traveller? Like would it get more lonely or something? FTR, I have never been to clubs/bars alone before and thus will be a bit hesitant as it is.

It anyways would be quite hot in Thailand in March and it will be the burning season time so I don't intend to go to the north in this trip."

ThailandTourism,This kind of behavior irks me,"Seen it a couple of times now, and by Asian tourists (not Thai). 

At the breakfast buffet they fill up the table with massive plates of food like they are having the their own private family feast. Then they leave at least half of it and the staff have to throw away a small mountain of food while looking at each other and discretely shaking their heads. 

It is an attitude I have a hard time to comprehend and I have zero respect for. This time it was a Asian family of 4, I didn’t catch the language but could have been Singlish. They also had a massive plate of fruit that they ended up not even touching. Like a small mountain of fruit. The mum went back and forth and just loaded up the table until there was no more space. 

I know I should not care, but this is behavior I find despicable."
ThailandTourism,COVID’s got us - please help us change our plans!,"Hi all. Me and my partner are currently in Phuket and have tested Covid + (first time). Because we’re both on immunesuppressant meds we don’t want to rush away from the main centre, in case we end up needing hospital care. 

We are currently booked in accomodation in Phuket until the 13th but will extend longer if needed. We have a flight booked from Chumphon to Bangkok to fly home on the 23rd.

We were planning to hop around most of the islands for a couple of days each, but now wondering if it’s better we spend longer on a few key islands and do day trips? 

Anyway, given our short time frame and keen-ness not to be too isolated from healthcare, what islands do you suggest we go to, and for how long each? 

Note, we are not party people, we also can’t rent scooters (insurance issues) so any islands where that’s required will be tricky.

Please help us, Covid brain is making this an impossible task…"

\-How hard is it to get a boat to PhiPhi Islands the day you feel like going? I know there are different types of boats, and I've read that some ferrys have unreliable times that they show up. Is there a certain type or company I should try to use?

  
\-Are there night markets on weekdays as well as weekends? A lot of articles only mention the big weekend markets

\-Any recommendations for places we shouldn't miss while we're in those 3 areas? I did a lot of browsing of this subreddit and just want to make sure my information is up to date. I know covid has hit different places hard and some activities that used to be awesome might have become  less appealing.

I've done searches on Railay Beach and it looks like only 3 hotels are available, but if I change the dates to earlier in the year I get more results. Are places already booking up for the high season? Or do some hotels just not accept bookings that far out? Or is Railay just small and there aren't that many places?

	2	There are three ferry operators (Tigerline, Satun Pakbara, and Bundhaya). Is there any major differences? Obvious things are important such as comfort, safety, travel time, aircon (if any offer inside seating), etc. Note we are planning on taking the afternoon ferry ride (departing approx 14:30).

I’ll be in Thailand for roughly week, then moving on through Cambodia. I will then be returning to Thailand via the North through Laos most likely.

Am I able to do this trip without an expensive multiple-entry tourist visa? As in, am I able to get two exemptions?

I think the answer to this is yes from what I understand, but do I need proof of onward travel once I land in BKK? As it will look as if I’m spending two months in Thailand due to the return ticket.

ThailandTourism,Question Regarding Tourist Visa on Old Non Expired Passport,"Hello,

I am arriving to Thailand this Sunday and have a 60-day tourist visa. I just recently picked up a new passport since I will be traveling the rest of Asia for a while after my visit there.

My visa is applied under my old passport which is valid for 2 more years. I went ahead and re-applied on the thai e-visa site with my new passport just in case.

Some questions:

1) Will having to applications in their system cause issues at the immigration counter when trying to enter the country?

2) If my new application does not get approved in time, should I just bring both passport books?

3) Do you think there would be any issues getting a 30 day extension if my visa was on my old passport?

Thanks in advance."

I'll need internet for work/netflix etc. Which plan do you recommend that is unlimited and not capped at very low speeds like 2mbps?

ThailandTourism,Was I tuk tuk scammed?,"I’ve read this sub a lot and it’s my first day in Bangkok. I was wandering around Saranrom Park and my gf had very short shorts on, we left the park and we’re going to head toward the river to grab some food when a man approached us. Told us the area required women to be covered, was very friendly, told us something about the monks in the area until 4pm, then we could come back. He wrote down some things we could do:
1. Golden Mount
2. Silk Outlet (apparently this was available to tourists today was the last of 7 days since the new year or something, made a comment on it being on TV)
3. Standing Buddha

He then told us to only take Blue Tuk-Tuks and not to pay more than 150bhat. At that moment, he hails a blue tuk tuk, gives the driver the list and clarifies 150bhat

The driver was super nice and took us to golden mount. Someone near the tuk tuk when we were leaving chatted us up and mentioned the silk outlet thing and it being the last day. Anyway, the guy drives us there, we tell him we have no interest and he tells me that he gets a gas card just for dropping us off for 5 mins.

We go inside, the guy also tells us something about it being the last day for tourists to buy or something, blah blah blah. We leave not buying anything and go to the Standing Buddha (wat Indharaviharn). He waits for us there and offers to take us to the reclining Buddha for 20 bhat. We decline and he takes us back home for the 150bhat.

I’m familiar with the Grand Palace scam, did I just fall for this? I didn’t feel like I was really ripped off since he drove us around and back for 150bhat. It was weird since it was a random guy on street, not even at the grand palace (near it though) then a separate tuk tuk driver.

Also, is there a difference between the blue and green tuk-tuk?"
ThailandTourism,Where to base for 2 weeks in southern Thailand,"My wife and I (37 each) are long term travelling and we already spent a month in northern Thailand, but will be returning in a few weeks to do get some beach time, but unsure how to allocate our time. As we've been travelling for awhile, we're a little burnt out and not interested in doing much moving around so just looking to spend about 2 weeks in one general area without moving locations every few days.

We're not into partying, but some nice spots to have a drink and socialize with other backpackers would be nice. As we're travelling for a year, we are definitely budget conscious.

Basically just looking for a chill place with beautiful beaches that we can read, not crazy expensive or full of resorts, limited drunk kids on gap year haha. I'm debating taking a diving course if the budget allows so maybe some access to diving would be great too.

I've heard Koh Samui and Koh Lanta are good from other travellers but curious to know more."

ThailandTourism,Sounds obvious but make sure you have smaller bills for taxis else some will pocket the whole lot,"I still feel angry at myself for letting it happen but I was jet lagged and tired. Ordered a bolt from Sukhumvit to Khaosan for 350, got there and stupidly realised I only had a 1000, scumbag driver saw it then said no change no change! Yeah yeah I can report them etc etc etc but just wanted it over with so gave said scumbag the 1000. Just be careful guys and try to break up as many 1000s as you can in a 7-11 or something. 

Now the bike taxis on bolt on the other hand.....ha. I've genuinely never had an issue with them and they actually go out of their way to get you change even if you pay with a high bill, for instance it happened that I had a 500 then the biker took me to a 7-11 for no extra cost and let me break it down.

ThailandTourism,Airport SIM card - can I add funds/data to it once it's expired?,"I was in Thailand about a month ago and I bought one of the SIM cards at the airport in Bangkok which gave me 7 days of use, which was perfect for the amount of time I spent there.

Now I will be going back to Thailand next week for close to a month. Does anybody know if I will be able to ""top up"" this SIM card, or if it's locked to the amount of time it was purchased with? I don't have a problem with buying a new one, but since I still have one I figured I'd check.

I unfortunately don't have it on me or I would check to see the provider or any other useful information. So if anybody has experience with this please comment away! Or if anybody here knows of a cheaper way or good place to buy one for a month. I will be flying into Bangkok again.

ThailandTourism,Koh Samui - best area for a group?,"Hey Friends,

Wondering which area of Koh Samui is best for us. We're a small international team (5 people) that started working together during the pandemic and are meeting for the first time. We're looking to rent a big Villa for the week so everyone can kinda hang out and generally get to know each other outside of a Zoom call.  


Number 1 on the list is access to a quality sandy beach - probably even a beachfront spot. We have a couple surfers and a few loungers that will definitely take advantage. Nightlife is less important since half of us don't drink - so a 15-30 min drive is totally fine. Nearby restaurants are a  bonus.   


Are there any areas that are clear standouts for what we need? Thanks so much!"
ThailandTourism,Rayong and Eastern Gulf islands in August,"Hi all. I've been lucky enough to spend a fair amount of time in Thailand, but have always been to the Bangkok area and the north. I was planning a three or four week trip during late July/ August to finally see the south and the islands, but I'm aware that it is rainy season during that time. If love some suggestions and feedback! 


My plan was to travel from Bangkok -&gt; Pattaya -&gt; Rayong -&gt; Koh Samed -&gt; Trat -&gt; Koh Chang -&gt; Koh Kood. I'm combining a holiday with scoping out possible places to live and work (international school teacher), hence why I'm visiting Pattaya and Rayong. 


I've heard that Koh Samed has a microclimate that means it has less rainfall than the other islands, and I'm very open to spending most of my time there and skipping the other islands if needed. I'm in my 30s, not big on massive parties but appreciate a decent bar, and very happy to spend most of my time swimming, snorkelling, reading or exploring. 


I don't mind a rainstorm at all, I think they're beautiful! But I would like some time to spend on the beach.... If anyone has visited this area during rainy season I'd love to hear your experiences!"

ThailandTourism,Koh Samui Airport to Haad Rin Beach,"Hi All,

I'll be traveling to Haad Rin beach in April and have looked at some previous threads here but unsure on transport to and from the islands. We land in Koh Samui around 4p (16:00), but it looks like the last Ferry runs at 5p (17:00). A couple questions:

Is this enough time between landing to make the flight? 

Would we need a taxi, or do we grab a pick-up truck to the Ferry?

Is there any airport to Haad Rin (full service) that anyone recommends?

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you for any/all help!"

I was under the impression going by ferry was the only option and don’t quite understand the variety of taxi options being shown."

ThailandTourism,Double checking requirements.,"I’ve researched and just wanted some reassurance: I’m flying out of the US on Korean Airlines, I will not be in China, Hong Kong, or Macau. So travel insurance isn’t required since I won’t need testing for re-entry to US because I won’t be in those 3 destinations? I know travel insurance is a good idea but I’ve never had it the last 6 times I’ve been.

I won’t need K-ETA since I won’t have to pick up any checked bags at Seoul/Incheon? I only have a few hours layover and only carrying a backpack."

ThailandTourism,Book/Joining a tour in Bangkok last minute,"Got into Bangkok last night and my 2 friends hadn't decided if they wanted to do a tour of Grand Palace, Wat Pho, Wat Arun or not, so I hadn't booked anything.

Last night while we were out to dinner they decided they didn't want to, so when I got back to the hotel around 1am (2/8) I figured I could go on Klook and book it last minute but it doesn't give me the option

I'd ideally like to join a group tour for today (2/8).  I've checked a couple different sites that offer tours and I'm not able to select same day on any of them.

Anybody have any advice how to make that happen?"

ThailandTourism,Advice on itinerary,"Hi guys, I don't have a lot of time in Thailand but I have seen a lot of national parks, which one's are the most worth it?

for a day trip from Bangkok:

\-Samut Prakan Ancient city

\-Kanchanburi and Erewan waterfalls 

\-Sukhotai 

\-Ayutthaya

\-Khao Yai National park (I read a lot of good things about this one)

I already want to make a daytrip to the floating market and railway market.

I was wondering which ones of the above are the most worth it?

I have a week in Bangkok so I would love to make a daytrip.

What are good experiences in Bangkok? for example going to a Muay Thai fight?

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The last week I will stay in Krabi, I figured out that Railay and Phra Nang Beach are great so I would love to stay there. I would love to go to an elephant sanctuary, Phuket and Khao Sok National park? are they worth it? 

&amp;#x200B;

What are other good daytrips from Krabi? Perhaps some islands with a boat?

ThailandTourism,Getting from Ayutthaya to Sukhothai - am I missing something?,"So I want to visit Ayutthaya (1 day) and Sukhothai (2 days), travelling North from Bangkok to Chiang Mai. I am on a bit of a tight schedule, so don't want to spend most of the day travelling from Bangkok to Sukhothai. 

12GO shows there is a bus departing from Ayutthaya at 19 oin the evening and arriving at Sukhothai at 1 am. Is it a viable option? My hotel shows to be just 15 min walk from the bus station, but are there tuk tuks at this time of night? 

Or is it better to accept a lost half of the day and just take an early morning train from Bangkok and change to Phitsanulok?

Sorry if it's an obvious question, but it's my first time in Thailand and I am not sure I am assessing difficulties correctly."
ThailandTourism,Proof of leaving Thailand - can this be with a separate airline?,"Hopefully a simple enough question, but one I’ve been confused by given that I’ve seen the need for a ‘return’ ticket a lot for entry requirements.

My plan is to arrive in Thailand with one airline on a one-way flight, stay for 12 days, then leave for Japan with another airline on a one-way flight.

Given the wording around a ‘return’ flight, will this still be fine if I have printed out confirmation for leaving the country, both when I board the flight there, and at passport control? Both flights have already been booked and paid for.

Thanks in advance!"
ThailandTourism,Short trip to Thailand,I'll be on Bangkok in March 16-20 to attend a two day concert. It will happen at Mar 18-19 (Sat and Sun) around Union Mall. Both days of the concert starts early (2pm) so I think I'll be free after that. My accommodation is near the pratunam market and I'll arrive there at lunchtime. My flight going back is in the late evening so I still have time to do things before lunch. Can you suggest some activities that I can do on my period of stay? I want to consider doing day trip to Ayutthaya on March 17 but I've been seeing a mixed review about it on this sub. Some suggest doing an overnight stay there to fully maximize the experience. I'm mostly interested in visiting temples and trying good local foods. Thanks!
ThailandTourism,Hotels vs Hostels for first time solo trip?,"I have been to Thailand once before with friends. This time I am planning for a solo trip in March for 2 weeks. However, I am very confused between hostels &amp; hotels. 

I have never stayed at hostels before so I am anyway a bit skeptical about them. Moreover, I think that hostels are not ""guest friendly"" which is something that I need. Also, I will be working for 4-5 days so I need to have peace in the morning on those days. Considering all these things, I feel that a hotel might be a better option.

However, I also worry that this might mean loneliness given that I won't be having any chances to meet people to go hit the bars with(or anywhere else on the mornings when I am not working). Not sure what to do. I even thought of considering the option of taking a hostel for 2 days and then shifting to a hotel for the remaining time. But I think that would result in the same problem later because once you leave the hostel, you might actually end up splitting up with whatever small group you might have created in the hostel.

Are there any hostels that might fit my requirements in Bangkok(preferably in Sukhumvit), Pattaya &amp; Chang Mai?"

The Ao Nang beach is too noisy for my taste, but staying at the hotel pool all day seems like a waste as well. Any chill things to do here? Quieter beaches? 

Sorry for this stupid question, but I just want to make the most out of my last 2 days since a third of my trip fell into the water."
ThailandTourism,45 Day Visa Exemption Question," 

Hi guys, I just wanted to clarify a few things to make sure I understand the visa exemption situation correctly.

I'm planning on travelling to Thailand at the end of February or early March from the UK, so I get the 45-day visa exemption.

If I'm coming before the 31st of March, is it correct that I still qualify for the full 45 days + a 30-day extension, if I choose to extend it before the 31st of March?

Also, when I arrive, I know I need to have proof of onward travel within 45 days, but do I also need to show accommodation for the full duration or is booking a hotel for a week or two fine? My plan is to stay in a hotel for 1-2 weeks and then move into an Airbnb, but I planned on sorting that out when I arrive in Thailand"

ThailandTourism,Anxious About Hotels - Advice,"Hello, Reddit! I’m currently in Phuket w/my boyfriend and am nervous about the hotels I booked for the rest of our stay. 

Our current hotel is a beautiful resort that has really blown us away with how wonderful the grounds are and how great the staff have been treating us. Everyone has been incredibly accomodating, the food is delicious, and the beach is phenomenal. We really felt the trip started off with a bang!

Now here’s where my anxiety is getting the better of me. I made the fool’s mistake of trying to find really nice hotels to book for us and booked two that seemed great at the time, but the more I read about them and their recent reviews, the more nervous I get to actually show up.

The next hotel we planned to stay at was Saii Phi Phi Island Village, as it was the highest rated for Phi Phi Island. It looked like a dream, and we were able to afford a nice room. I was a little sussed during the booking part bc of how difficult it was (i.e couldn’t book it directly through their website so I ended up having to email them and take a whole week to get the room booked + the way too expensive boat transfer and it is non-cancellable), but now the google reviews are fueling my nightmares. Poor living conditions for the rooms and the boat transfer either making you walk through the actual sea to get to the resort or suddenly stopping in the middle of the trip/right off shore to demand more money are just two points I saw that worried me (although if they were to demand more money this would be considered a breach of contract and my cc company could refund me). We’re supposed to get there in two days, yet we have not heard a single thing from the resort about our transfer details.

The last hotel is Deevana Patong Resort and Spa. This one didn’t worry me as much, but some review details still concerned me and I stressed myself out about the first hotel already, so now the stress is just carrying over to this one.

Has anyone stayed at either of these hotels or had positive/negative experiences here? Thailand has been amazing so far and I’d really like to make sure I’m putting myself and the love of my life into safe, pleasant situations and places. Any advice is appreciated.

Thank you!"

ThailandTourism,Travel recommendations for adventurer! [request],"I will visit Thailand for almost a month and I don’t really have a plan yet where exactly I want to go. 
I am a very adventurous person and don’t wish to go to the 'mainstream' attractions. I wouldn’t mind areas which are not known for tourism and its not necessary that everyone speaks English. Generally I love to stay with locals rather then always staying in ho(s)tels while I am traveling.
I love hiking in nature and would love to do some cool tracks that are challenging with nice landscapes, flora or fauna to discover (long day-hikes or multiday-hikes preferably). 
Also I really enjoy taking part in local festivities, visiting historical and cultural sites and getting to know the daily life.
Do you guys have some recommendations, maybe some hidden gems or generally cool places to visit?

My last weekend is 17-19 Feb. Want something relaxing, not overly obscene or touristy, for solo travel as an 18 year old guy. 

I thought about the following options:

Phuket: Away from Patong if possible, been there before. Beaches

Kanchanaburi - Closer to BKK and national parks. 

Chiang Rai - Natural, mountains, and temples

Any suggestions? I like water, mountains, and photogenic places. Prefer quiet but can also deal with cities.

My budget is around 5-7k baht. I don’t mind staying in hostels or whatever.

Preferably, I'd stay in a hotel on the beach or near the beach - I'm very down for something nestled in the forest. I'd like the closest beach to be good quality for relaxed lounging, going in the water, etc. 

I'm traveling solo and prefer not to be surrounded by kids/families, or really young party crowds. I want to be able to mingle without feeling crowded with tourists.

Things around I'd like to do:

* Kayaking and/or snorkling - general water activities
* The Natural Park - Emerald Pool
* Krabi Hot Springs - not a must, but cool if I fit it in
* Krabi Town night market - Not a must, but would like to
* Eat delicious things

Budget-wise, I'd like to stick around $150USD/night (5K Baht), but willing to go higher or lower for the right spot. Extra points if the hotel provides some transportation and has good food."

It seems to be 90% of who I'm matching. I went on a date last night, had a few drinks with some guys while there also who joined in, one of them suggested he thought my date could be having sex for money. I brought it up with her outside and she admitted it.

In hindsight there were signs, but, unlike other girls who have admitted it somewhat upfront from the start, she most certainly did not.

I went on a date with a girl on Saturday night who definitely wasn't a sex worker and there have been others I'm chatting with who don't tick any of the signs and so on. So I'm well aware these women do exist.

Honestly I think the only way to approach this for the rest of my time here is ""if you are not sure, then assume they are"". It will mean some potentially great girls might get overlooked but it will also save my wallet and heartbreak."
ThailandTourism,Wanting to do a visa run from Bangkok to Kuala Lumpur where I'll stay 4 days. Already stayed 75 days. Will it work?,"Hi,

as the title suggests I want to do a quick visa run from Bangkok to Kuala Lumpur and stay there a few nights. After that I would like to go back to Bangkok. I already extended the visa once and sadly I also overstayed the first time for 10 days. So I'm curious if it 1) works (lot of them say it works...others say they had issues and 2) if they're more strict with people that already overstayed.

I searched for this on google and reddit, but only found Conflicting information, so i was wondering if anyone had recent experience with this:

I have a flight at the end of March from Germany to Thailand Via Mascat, Oman.

In Thailand i will arrive at Suvarnabhumi and then transfer to a domestic flight to Samui.

The Domestic flight is with Bangkok airways, while the first two are with Oman Air, but all are on the Same ticket and booked together.

In BKK i have 1h 50 min to transfer to the new flight. Since its all one Ticket my Luggage will get checked through, but if i Transfer from intl. to Domestic will i need to go through Customs and Immigration at Suvarnabhumi or can i transfer directly to Domestic and do all the Customs and Visa Procedures at Samui Airport?  

Many posts Online said i will need to go through everything in BKK and that it could Take several hours depending on how busy it is, while some others mentioned being able to transfer directly to the connecting Flight in half an hour.

Any Advice is Appreciated, thanks!"

My options are as follows assuming one week in Thailand.

1. Arrive in BKK, go directly to Krabi - Stay 3 nights. Stay in Ao Nang, visit Railay beach, other surrounding areas. Return to BKK for 4 nights.
2. Arrive in BKK, go directly to Samui, take the ferry to Koh Phangan. Stay 3 nights in KP. Return to BKK for 4 nights.
3. Stay in BKK for one week. Look for excursions around the area.
4. Arrive in BKK, directly Fly to Saigon for 3/4 nights. Come back to BKK.

ThailandTourism,Help review my plan to travel from Padang Besar Malaysia to Hat Yai,"Hi fellow travellers, I will reach Padang Besar (Malaysia) at around noon. The straight forward plan would be to travel via the train from Padang Besar to Hat Yai, which would take around 55 mins. Once I reach Hat Yai, I will first have to collect my tickets from the parcel room before it closes at 1700 (booked my tickets through 12go), and then proceed to take the overnight train to Bangkok at 1745.

The train timing for Padang Besar to Hat Yai is between 1540 (Malaysia) to 1535 (Thailand), however I am worried as I heard that the train is known for being late. It is quite risky as if I were to reach Hat Yai later than 1700, I might not get the tickets and be able to get to Bangkok :( 

Found out that there is an alternative way to travel from Padang Besar to Hat Yai, which is through the mini van. First, pass the border from Padang Besar Malaysia to Thailand side. Then proceed to take their mini van to their bus terminal/ clock tower. Lastly take a Grab from the bus terminal to the Hat Yai train station. Anyone able to confirm this?

Another question I have is the Hat Yai train station parcel room for ticket collection, where is it at? Tried searching on google but not much info. The train station doesn't look too huge, so shouldn't be an issue walking about trying to find it. 

This is my first trip travelling via train to Bangkok so I am nervous, worried and excited, all at the same time. Hence trying my best to gather as much information as possible, so I can mentally prepare myself"

ThailandTourism,6 month stay in Thailand (Chiang Mai). Visa options?,"My wife (33y), baby daughter (3 months) and myself (34y) want to stay in Thailand for 6 months in total. We booked one-way plane tickets to Chiang Mai this September and are very much looking forward to it. But we could really use some insight regarding our visa strategy.

I have found that we could apply for a 60 day single entry tourist visa in our home country and extend this for another 30 days once in Thailand. We would then leave the country for a few days going to Malaysia or Vietnam and apply for another 60 day single entry tourist visa, extend this again for 30 days once in Thailand, and voila, we have 6 months stay in total.

However there is a possible issue with this approach. 
To arrange the Visa it says that we need to show an onward plane ticket leaving Thailand. I read online that we might run into some issues either with the Visa application, the airline and/or immigration if this flight is not within the 60 days of the Visa, as a 30 visa extension is officially not guaranteed to be given. 
Any tips, tricks on how to deal with this?
What would be the most efficient way to stay for 6 months in total?

And does anyone knows if overland travel is also allowed as proof of onward travel? e.g. booking a 3rd class train ticket online from Hat Yai (Thailand) to Padang Basar (Malaysia)?

I'm a 100% remote worker who earns $130K per year ($90K from a 9-to-5 and $40K from a side hustle). Both my company and my clients (so far) are American.

I'm planning to stay in Thailand for 2-5 years, living on under $1K per month so that I can save and invest 60%+ of my income (basically impossible in the USA). The problem is that I don't know what kind of visa to apply for.

It looks like the Tourist Visa is for 90 days max. A Work Visa is out of the question since I'm not planning to work for a Thai organization. The Elite Visa, which would let me stay in Thailand for 5 years, costs a whopping 600K baht, or $18K, which is way out of my price range.

What visa should I apply for if I want to minimize (1) the cost and (2) the hassle of renewal?"
ThailandTourism,Basic questions for when arriving in Bangkok...,"Heading to Thailand from Australia at the end of the month. Haven't travelled a lot, and this is the first time I'm not relying on someone else to do the bulk of the planning, so just have some (probably stupid) questions about the daybwe arrive in Bangkok

- Will we need baht on hand when we fly in? I seem to hear conflicting reports about this, seems like a lot of people say you don't need

- I'm Australian. So am visa exempt. Will I still need proff of where Im staying? Do I need to actually print anything out, or is it fine just having the hotel address?

- is it wise to Taxi from the airport? Is there a specific taxi rank at Suvarnabhumi I should head to? Don't want to immediately get overcharged for being a tourist.

- Cash withdrawal. Am I fine to just do that at ATMs where needed, or is it worth going to a currency exchange at the airport first?"
ThailandTourism,Quickest way to get Thai tourist visa in the USA?,The Miami consulate was the quickest way for residents of The Bahamas to get their Thai tourist visas. It normally would take a 24 hour turnaround. The Miami consulate is now permanently closed. Does anyone have any experience applying for a Thai tourist visa in the US? What’s the quickest method? I’ve heard horror stories of it taking weeks in DC.
ThailandTourism,Airport rail or Taxi,"I’m arriving at BKK airport at around 4pm on a Friday afternoon. After reading a few posts about rush hour traffic, would it better to take a taxi or Airport rail to Sukhumvit at that time? I’m saying on Soi 2 JW Marriot."
ThailandTourism,Thai education visa police exam?,"Hello. I'm on Thai language visa learning Thai and the school I'm currently at is really terrible so I'm learning on my own mostly. 

I was threatened to study hard because there are allegedly ""official exams from the ministry of education"" that I have to attend.

But anytime I ask for details or even a date, I get no answer. Are those Thai proficiency exams a reality?"
